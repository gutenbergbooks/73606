<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The peddlars, or packmen, of ancient days, who were the first recognized merchants,
realized fully the advantage of displaying their wares before prospective customers.
Gaining entry to a castle, a palace, or a mansion, the packman spread his
goods upon the floor to best advantage and then awaited patiently while the assembled
bevy of women gazed enraptured upon the treasures at their feet. If he could not obtain
permission to open his pack his visit was fruitless of result.</p>

<p class='c007'>In old Bagdad arose the custom of open booths built before the entrances of
houses, wherein was attractively displayed the merchandise offered for sale. This
custom is still extensively followed in Eastern countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Cheapside, in London, the method was to hang upon iron hooks along the
front of the building such articles as might induce the observer to buy, or entice him
to enter the shop.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same custom was prevalent in the Colonial days in America, and is not
yet fully obsolete.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus from the earliest days merchants well knew the value of display, and the
modern show window is the logical outcome or development of that knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Careful research fails to determine where the show window was first utilized
as an adjunct to merchandizing. It is probably a gradual development from the
small, many-paned front window of the merchant shop, following the natural transformation
of shops into stores and of crude green-glass panes into clear plate-glass
fronts.</p>

<p class='c007'>However it came about, the modern mercantile establishment, whether located in
a retired village or upon the main street of a thriving city, is to-day deemed incomplete
without a front of the clearest and best plate-glass. These windows are not intended
to light the interior of a store, although indirectly they may serve such purpose.
Their prime object is to sell goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without advertising the modern merchant sinks into oblivion. The busy world
forgets him, and he is left to himself—to rust, to vegetate, or to fail ignominiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merchants of olden times stood in front of their shops and cried “buy!—buy!”
in imploring tones. Modern merchants still cry “buy!—buy!” but they do it in a
different way. They advertise in newspapers and display their wares in their show
windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the three grades—the three developments in advertising. The street
crier, the newspapers, the show window. The last mode of inducing trade is the
modern one, and therefore the best. More goods are sold through window display
than through newspaper advertising. It is more direct. The newspaper advertisement
says: “We have goods to sell.” The show window says: “Here they are!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the judicious use of advertising through newspapers must not be discouraged.
Every man, woman and child in town does not pass your windows. Those
who do not may read in the newspaper of your attractive display of goods, and so be
induced to pass your way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most successful of modern merchants use the newspapers to announce their
window displays. This combination of the two greatest forces in advertising has been
found to succeed beyond any other method.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make a display of goods in your window that is most attractive, that will
sell readily the articles exhibited, is to-day acknowledged an art.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many things are to be considered. There are the technicalities to be learned,
judgment and good taste to be exercised, color harmony to be secured; and, above
all, there must be positive knowledge as to what constitutes an attractive exhibit, and
what will arouse in the observer cupidity and a longing to possess the goods you
offer for sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said that a window decorator is born, and not made. Yet we find
that those “born” decorators must acquire knowledge of technicalities and detail
work before they can succeed. Who shall determine which are “born,” and which
are “made” decorators? The “born musician” must, unfortunately, learn to play the
fiddle, and the “born blacksmith” must be taught to shoe a horse. And the worldly
cynic will tell you that under proper instruction and with a desire to learn, any son of
Adam can play the fiddle or shoe a horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have never known a man who desired to learn the art of decorating fail to attain
skill and subsequent success. Perhaps it is only those “born” ones who desire
to learn.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that a clumsy man, a man without judgment or taste, a man destitute
of knowledge of the requirements of modern merchandizing, might prove a lamentable
failure as a store decorator. But I have never known such a man desire to learn the
art.</p>

<p class='c007'>The object of this book is to place before the novice the instructions necessary
to fit him for successful work. The author believes that this volume contains all information
necessary to enable a student to acquire proficiency in the Art of Decorating
Dry Goods Windows and Interiors. The field of merchandizing is so broad that this
work is confined to dry goods decorating, although many of the chapters will be of
service in decorating windows with other lines of goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much of the information offered has been gained by personal experience, yet
I am greatly indebted to many brother decorators, and especially to prominent members
of The National Association of Window Trimmers of America, for assistance
in my attempt to place clearly before my readers the many details of the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>Practical methods have in every instance been preferred to theoretical. The simplest
and easiest way of accomplishing any work is always the best.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am hopeful that those desiring to attain skill in decorating will find much useful
information in these pages, and if this book proves of real assistance to its readers
my object in writing it will have been accomplished.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c008'>HOW TO PLAN STORE FRONTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In building a store on modern principles
the front is more important than any other
detail. For, a store being intended for the
sale of merchandise, the front is the first
thing that meets the public eye, and by its
appearance the entire establishment is
judged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The size and shape of the windows depends,
of course, upon the size and location
of the store, but the principle consideration
is to obtain as large an expanse of window
as possible, and convenient entrances.</p>

<p class='c007'>In single store fronts, which we shall use
as examples, the ordinary arrangement is
similar to that in diagram A, having the
entrance,
with double doors, in the center. This
gives two good sized windows, if the front
is of fair breadth, and admits the customer
to the central aisle.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_005b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To avoid dividing the expanse of window,
and to render the display more impressive,
a popular arrangement is that in
diagram B, having the entrance at one side.
Which side to place the entrance is determined
by the trend of traffic, the entrance
being placed nearest to the busy portion of
the street, as more convenient to the customer.
Exception.—It is argued by some
merchants that it is better to place the entrance
furthest from the crowded portion of
the street, as in this case the people must
first pass before the window.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_005c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It will be noted that people intending to
enter the store will not be influenced by the
window display, in which case the location
of the entrance is immaterial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Diagram B shows the bevelled entrance,
slanting diagonally from the front window
to the door, and thus giving the public a
glance at the small side window in passing
or entering. In diagram D we show the
curved front, in which the side window is a
curved or semi-circular pane. This style
is very attractive, but more expensive, and
is more liable to be broken than the flat
pane.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_005d.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_005g.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Diagram C shows one of the most popular
arrangements of store fronts. This allows
for a double entrance, with a broad
expanse of window between. In wide
fronts these entrances are double doors, in
narrower fronts a single door is sufficient.
Variations of this front which has bevelled
entrances, are shown in diagrams E
and F. The first has the semi-circular end
panes, which are recommended as especially
imposing, and the latter shows a
square perfectly rectangular turn for the
side panes. The advantage claimed for this
method is that it attracts the attention of
those approaching the window more quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>than will the slant or curve, but this does
not appear likely unless the front projects
beyond the line of the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large central pane, with double or
single side entrances, is a very successful
style of front, and is strongly endorsed by
those who have used them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It sometimes happens that thick pillars
of masonry obstruct the front, as shown in
diagram G. In this case the window panes
should be set at the outer edge of the pillars,
rather than against the inner edge, as
much of the effect of the front would be
lost by the projecting pillars. The entrance,
however, should be set at the inner
edges of the pillars, as indicated.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_006a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Posts are always to be avoided in window
spaces, and there is seldom an occasion
where they are really necessary. But
where a front is rebuilt or altered and posts
cannot be avoided, they should invariably
be set directly back of the window frames,
as shown in diagram H. When they are
placed in this manner each window has a
clear space back of the pane, and the decorator
has an opportunity of putting one distinct
trim in each window. But if the posts
occupy the center, or even the sides of the
window, no decorator on earth can trim the
space properly or effectively.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_006b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Diagram H also illustrates the continuous
front, where many windows are placed
side by side. Any of the fronts previously
described can be so extended indefinitely.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many other styles of store
fronts, but most of them come under the
head of “freak fronts,” and are only appropriate
for the special buildings for which
they were designed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main points to consider in building
a front, are, (a) to get as large an expanse
of glass as possible; (b) to use iron framework,
occupying the least space where the
panes join; (c) to avoid the use of posts
back of the panes, but where they are necessary
to place each post behind the point
where two large plate-glass panes are joined
together.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new idea in show window fronts is to
allow the two sheets of glass to come together
at the corners, where they are held
by brass braces and set screws so that there
is no corner space at all. This arrangement
looks well and has several advantages.
The glass is less liable to break than when
set against a post or frame; and all shadows
in the window are avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last, if you have an old-fashioned front,
get your landlord to take it out and replace
it with a modern, plate-glass front. If he
refuses, move elsewhere. You cannot afford
to be in the mercantile business without
good windows to back up your enterprise.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c008'>THE SHOW WINDOW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In attempting to explain the fundamental
principles of successful store decoration,
the window is the first thing to be considered,
and there are all kinds of windows,
little and big, upright and oblong, cramped
and spacious. Some are hard to get at;
some have big, awkward posts in them;
but no matter what they are or how undesirable
they seem, remember that anything
with a pane of glass before it may be made
a show window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Build a window floor on a level with the
lower edge of the glass; build it strongly
and make it as deep as you are able. Three
feet is a fair depth; six feet is not too deep.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BOXING A WINDOW.</h3>

<p class='c010'>In order to produce a good window
there must be a proper foundation to work
upon. An open-backed window is an impossibility
as considered from a window
trimmer’s standpoint, save in very few cases
where articles are small and only require
a window shelf to display them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>All windows should have a substantial
board backing and sides extending about
one-half the height of the window itself.
A door should be made in this at one
side, to permit the trimmer easy entrance
and enable you to reach any goods
you may wish to withdraw from the window.
Above this backing it is desirable
to have a sash reaching to the ceiling, which
will serve to admit light and prevent dust
reaching the trim.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distance of the backing from the
glass is a matter of choice. Some prefer
very deep window embrasures, and for
furniture, carpets, stoves and like bulky
articles, they are undoubtedly best. For
displays of light, small articles, a shallow
window is very desirable, and furnishings,
notions, etc., may be effectively arranged
in thirty inches space. For the
general window, however, where various
classes of merchandise are required to be
exhibited, a depth of from four to five feet
is best; and even six feet, especially for a
clothing or cloak trim, is not considered
too deep for good effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The floor of the window embrasure
should be made perfectly level, as this will
admit of more substantial framework than
an incline. A removable, sloping floor may
be provided for use when desired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Against the solid backing brackets and
shelves may be secured, their arrangement
being altered as occasion demands. It also
admits of tacking the draperies in a substantial
manner, and there is a satisfaction
in knowing your window is solid and that
any fragile articles displayed are perfectly
safe.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOW TO WASH WINDOWS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A clean window pane is a necessity in
a show window. Nothing destroys the attractiveness
of a really good display so
readily and effectively as a streaked, flyspecked
glass in front of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many merchants dread window washing
day. It shouldn’t be a bugbear when a
simple method like the following is understood.
Wait until the sun is off the window,
for if the sun is shining on the glass
it will look streaked after drying, irrespective
of the amount of muscle expended in
the rubbing. Dust the window thoroughly,
inside and out, and don’t touch the glass
until after the inside woodwork has been
cleansed. Use nothing but warm water,
mixed with sufficient ammonia in washing
the glass. Steer clear of soap. Dry the
windows with the rubber cleaner or soft
cotton cloth. Linen leaves lint on the
glass. Polish with paper; that’s all that’s
necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TO PREVENT WINDOWS FROM FROSTING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>One of the merchant’s greatest trials is
the sweating and frosting of windows in
cold weather, rendering them useless for
display purposes at the very season when
they are most valuable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much has been written concerning methods
of prevention of frost, but most of them
are theoretical, and, while they work well
in some instances, are absolute failures in
others.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE CAUSE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Scientists will tell you that the reason
a window sweats is because there is an uneven
temperature on the opposite sides of
the window pane. The cold air outside
chills the pane, which condenses the moisture
in the warm air inside as it strikes the
glass, and the moisture is deposited in the
form of “sweat” upon the inner surface of
the glass. It then freezes, producing
“frost.” Occasionally, when there is moisture
in the outer air, a deposit is also made
upon the outer surface of the glass, but in
either case the frost arises from the uneven
temperature of the air inside and outside
the window glass.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE REMEDY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The foregoing cause of the evil being
understood, it is also plain that any arrangement
which will render the temperature
of the air the same on both sides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of the pane will remedy the difficulty. Any
other method is obviously imperfect and
ineffectual. If the temperature within and
without the window is the same the glass
cannot sweat or frost.</p>

<p class='c007'>To obtain an even temperature it is absolutely
necessary to box the window. It
must be cut off entirely from the other part
of the store.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The space under modern show windows
is used largely for ventilating cellars. Our
sketch shows half of this space used for
ventilating cellar, and other half as a cold
air passage to allow the outside air to pass
through the double perforated window
floor, thereby keeping the air within the
window enclosure approximately the same
temperature as the outside, and thereby
preventing the sweating and freezing, so
annoying to the trimmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>A A, open space between double perforated
bottom, to be filled with loose cotton
to permit the air to pass, but dense
enough to keep back the dust from the
street.</p>

<p class='c007'>The floor of the window should be made
of boards, perforated and made to fit in
snugly without fastening down, so they can
be taken up occasionally to clean out the
dust that will accumulate in time.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>FIG. 3.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 3 shows how boards may be used
without being perforated. Small pieces of
wood are nailed on one edge of each board,
say about one-eighth inch thick, so as to
keep the boards about that distance apart.</p>

<p class='c007'>C is a small door that opens into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>store room to reach the cold air space, for
cleaning occasionally.</p>

<p class='c007'>B, opening for lighting and ventilating
the cellar. A trap door may be arranged
to fit over the opening B, but a better
arrangement is to have two sashes of glass
to fit the front of the openings immediately
back of the wire screens shown in Fig. 2.
If hinged at the top, they can be opened
by pulling back with a cord or chain from
the inside of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 2 shows a wire screen now much
used instead of the more expensive iron
grille work formerly in vogue.</p>

<p class='c007'>When possible, a glass roof should be
used to inclose the window, in which case
the lights may be arranged above the glass.
This prevents heating the window. In
using floor drapings, employ only cheesecloth,
or some light material that will allow
air to pass through.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this may seem to require considerable
trouble and alteration of your windows,
but wherever this method has been used
it has been found thoroughly practical
and an absolute prevention of frost.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>OTHER METHODS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>(1) An electric fan kept constantly in
motion in a corner of the window is said
to avoid frosting by keeping the atmosphere
in circulation, and thus preventing
condensation upon the surface of the glass.
In a large window there should be two
fans, in opposite corners, and these may be
easily concealed from view.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) Electric Heaters.—As almost every
store is now provided with electric light
service, and electric heaters can be purchased
in all sizes on the open market, the
interest in this new application of electric
heating is universal. All that is necessary
is to place a small electric heater in the
window in any concealed position, and to
connect it with the lighting mains.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) Several washes for the window glass
have been recommended, but our observation
has been that these usually fail to
prevent frosting.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that one method will succeed
with a merchant, and fail when utilized by
his next door neighbor. It is hard to explain
this fact, save for the different atmospheric
conditions of the two rooms. It is
not unusual to see one window as opaque
as a sheet of felt and another loom up as
transparent as a crystal, when both are
apparently under the same conditions. One
sees a window free from frost where it is
entirely enclosed, and that seems to explain
the reason. But a few doors further on
another window similarly enclosed is covered
with ice. Some windows that have a
half-length enclosure inside are clear and
others are frosty, and some that are entirely
open to receive the heat of the store room
are clear while others are not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the various washes are pure
glycerine, in which a flannel cloth is dipped,
ammonia and salt, and alcohol and water.
As said before, these are seldom effective
in preventing frosting. The safest and best
remedy will be found in ventilation, as
above described.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c008'>SOME PRACTICAL HINTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Those who are inexperienced in window
decoration will need a few general instructions
before attempting to trim in a practical
and successful manner. Experience
has taught us several things which apply
so forcibly to the art of decoration that
they may be considered in the nature of
rules, and must be studied carefully and
thoroughly by the novice.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SUGGESTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The trouble with most window trimmers
and beginners is that they ignore
all suggestions offered, from the fact that
they are window trimmers, and are supposed
to know it all, which is a grave mistake
(for no man knows it all). From experience,
you will find that by listening to
any and all suggestions offered, there will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>be a time when you will be glad to accept
them. If you do not take to the suggestion,
pass it up, but in all cases it pays to
listen and act accordingly.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SIMPLICITY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>There is nothing more “fetching” in a
window than the simple artistic arrangement
of a few attractive goods. Simplicity
has been urged by almost every writer
upon window trimming, yet it is generally
disregarded. More err in crowding a window
than in displaying insufficient goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>A good background, throwing out a few
articles that are good values or distinct
novelties, may be relied upon to arrest the
attention of the passing shopper. It is poor
policy to display expensive and inexpensive
merchandise in the same window, or to
exhibit what is called a “mixed” window.
A crowded window bewilders the beholder,
and while he may admire the general arrangement
and wealth of color, no one item
will sufficiently attract him to induce him
to enter the store, or will impress his mind
so far that he will recollect it when occasion
arises to purchase. The most successful
show windows are those where a few
goods are well displayed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is bad advertising to display too many
lines in one window. The most effective
window usually contains but one line of
goods. Dress goods never show to advantage
when mixed with other articles, and
silks and calicos, in the same window, each
detract from the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Special windows always win more attention,
and are more easily trimmed and more
quickly changed when they have served
their purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DETAIL AND WORKMANSHIP.</h3>

<p class='c010'>I will here say a few words upon the subject
of detail work in window trimming.
I have always found that anything which
was worth doing at all was worth doing
well. It may take a little more time and
cost a little more money, but you will obtain
the desired results in the end, and
your window will be the means of increased
sales of the goods displayed.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have had a great deal of experience with
window trimmers, and have found that the
great majority of them do not pay that
strict attention to detail which is so necessary
in a perfectly dressed window. They
will say, “Oh, that is good enough,” “No
one will notice that,” etc., when they detect
some omission in the detail of the work.
But they are wrong, for a great many of
those whose attention is attracted to the
display will as quickly note the defect as
the skilled window trimmer himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the greatest troubles the window
trimmer has to contend with is the lack of
time necessary to do complete and perfect
work. The house wants the window
changed, and wants it immediately, ignoring
the fact that it requires time, both to
take out the old and put in the new display,
and on that account it is absolutely
necessary that a great deal of the work
should be done in the workshop before going
into the window at all. You may find
a picture or model that would make a good
subject for a novelty window of certain
kinds of goods, and it could be worked out
in fine style if only sufficient time were
given for detail work, that is, making all
of the different parts of the subject in their
proper place, and leaving out of the work
not the slightest detail necessary to make
the finished work identically like the picture
or model. This would, necessarily, require
considerable time and labor, but when
the trimmer gets advanced in the work he
will become so interested that he will not
be satisfied until he has it complete in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>The special efforts of the most successful
window trimmers are directed toward the
carrying out of the small details, without
which there can be no perfect specimen of
the window trimmer’s art, and for lack of
which so many windows present a crude
and unfinished appearance.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>WHAT TO DISPLAY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The mission of the show window is not to
display unsaleable goods, but to sell goods.
If you can’t make a pretty picture and sell
goods at the same time let the picture go,
but make a display that will sell the goods.
But don’t forget that if you can make the
window attractive enough to arrest the gaze
of the passerby your goods are half sold.
This may appear to you ambiguous at first,
but a little thought will teach you never to
lose sight of the fact that goods must be
sold, and that an attractive window will
help sell them. But a “picture window,”
in which the value or utility of the goods
is sacrificed to make the picture, is not art,
but foolishness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the selection of goods for your window
two classes are best. First, new goods,
of which there is ample stock; for, being
new and seasonable, they are in demand
and can be sold with profit and the money
reinvested. Second, old goods which must
be disposed of, probably at a sacrifice, in
order that the money tied up in them may
be used to better advantage. These last
are “bargain” windows and each article
must bear its price ticket. Cut the price
sufficiently to interest people. Bear in
mind that these goods might lie on your
shelves years without moving if there was
no show window to dispose of them. Properly
displayed and properly priced, the
show window will sell them like hot cakes,
even though they are old enough to have
gray whiskers. People dearly love bargains.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t make the mistake of selecting a
variety of goods for your display. Confine
it to one line as much as possible, and when
that is impossible confine it to kindred lines.
You don’t need so very many goods if you
know how to display them. Some of the
best windows I ever saw contained very few
goods; but, bear in mind, every piece stood
out as distinctly as a wart on a man’s nose.
At the same time a well-filled, or “stocky”
window, as it is called, frequently is quite
as effective as any, and a reputation for carrying
a full stock is a desirable thing for
any merchant. Unto them that have goods
shall be given trade. You can’t sell what
you haven’t got.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ROBBING WINDOWS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Frequently a merchant finds his stock
so reduced that the only size, color or style
of a certain article remaining is that displayed
in his window trim. When you have
a call for such an article do not rob your
window display, but take the customer’s
name and address and agree to send the article
C. O. D. when you change your window.</p>

<p class='c007'>This method has been adopted by all the
large stores, and has proven very satisfactory.
The effectiveness of your window remains
unimpaired, and usually a customer
is willing to wait in order to secure the desired
article. In rare instances, when there
is danger of a good sale being lost, this rule
may be abrogated, and the article taken
from the display; but if it is understood by
your patrons that no goods will be removed
from your windows until the trim is
changed, they will readily see the advisability
of such action, and be willing, in
most cases, to wait a reasonable length of
time.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>WINDOW TRIMMERS’ ROOM.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Every window trimmer should have a
fair sized room for the sole purpose of
keeping his fixtures, wax figures, a work
bench, etc. It should have plenty of
light, with one portion set aside for ticket
writing; a place with a door to keep out
the dust, in which to keep his cardboard,
cut in the desired sizes for his use; a place
to keep wax figures when they are not in
the windows (dust proof stalls, large
enough for each figure, are best); a sign in
the room to read, “A place for everything
and everything in its place.” Keep your
room locked and carry the key in your
pocket.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>TOOLS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A proper outfit or kit of tools is a necessity.
For carpenter work, such as building
your own framework, you will require
cross-cut and rip saws, chisels, screwdrivers,
awls and a hammer. Don’t attempt to
make very fine joints; it is unnecessary,
since the frame will all be covered. But be
sure your work is substantial and will not
pull apart. In order to preserve your lumber
for future use and to obtain strength
in your structure, use screws wherever possible,
first boring a hole with a small bit,
or, if the material is thin, using an awl to
make the holes for your screws. In your
tool box have partitions for all sizes of
screws, nails and tacks, and keep each size
separate.</p>

<p class='c007'>For upholstery work, such as pleating,
puffing, draping and covering the frame
with cloth, you will need a large pair of
shears and an upholsterer’s hammer, which
has a long, extended head. Also provide
yourself with a small pincushion, 3 or 4
inches square, and put a loop of tape on
opposite corners. These loops can be
placed over two buttons of your vest, to
hold it firmly in place, or you can pin the
cushion by the loops to any part of your
person. Don’t loan your tools to anyone.
Keep them locked up in your tool box.
Carry the box into the window with you, for
then you have everything at hand you will
be likely to need. Keep a supply of screw eyes
and hooks, wire and cord in your box,
for you will often need them. Tools for
electrical work will be explained in the
chapter on electrical designs.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE SCREEN.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Professional window trimmers prefer
usually to work during the night or early
morning, when they are uninterrupted by
either employes, customers or curious
groups who delight in watching them from
without.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, often necessary to work
during the day, and in this case a screen
of muslin or cambric is stretched across the
window to insure privacy. This screen is
almost a necessity to the merchants in
smaller cities, where all work is done in daytime,
and may be utilized to good advantage
in attracting the curiosity of passers-by.</p>

<p class='c007'>One merchant we know of has painted
across his screen in big, black letters,
“Watch This Window!” Another uses the
following: “We are Getting Ready to Surprise
You.” And still another: “This
Window is Dead To-day, but will be Alive
To-morrow!” Many texts may be selected,
but a sign of some sort upon the window
screen is certainly a good advertisement.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>OPEN WINDOW TRIMMING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Many decorators of late have found a distinct
advantage in leaving shades up and
dispensing with screens. They work in
plain view of the crowds that congregate to
watch them. This would be embarrassing
to the beginner or the modest man, but its
advantage lies in being an added attraction
for the store. People are often curious to
know how a window display is built up and
arranged, and enjoy watching the workman.
Often the people attracted are the
loafers of a town, and those who, having
no business of their own, would not be likely
to bring business to the store. But in
cities where the streets are crowded, the
open window may be considered a distinct
attraction to the casual observer and the
general public.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last three chapters are preparatory
to the real work of decorating, and should
be read with care by the student of the art.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c008'>FRAMEWORK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The beginning of any work is always its
most important period. Begin right and
you may succeed; begin wrong and you are
certain to fail.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a window display is conceived in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the fertile brain of the artist, his first work
is to erect the framework for his creation.
He must have something to build upon.
Many trimmers—even some experienced
ones who ought to know better—go to the
wood pile when they wish to erect a framework.
I advise every one to carry on hand
a stock of standard pieces for frames. Almost
any one who can handle a saw can
make them himself, but a carpenter may be
employed where necessary. Not a great variety
of pieces are required, and the number
of them depends on how many windows
you have to trim. But with a supply
of the regulation standard pieces you may
construct an endless array of arches, pillars,
shelving, centerpieces, pedestals, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trimmer who is driven to attack the
wood pile when he starts to make a display
is not only to be pitied, but is badly handicapped
in his work. The amount of time
consumed in building each special fixture in
your window is detrimental to profitable
trimming, and annoying to yourself and
your employer. A well equipped fixture
room is a money maker, as well as a time
and labor saver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first system of standard pieces I will
explain is that adapted and invented by the
veteran decorator, Charles W. Morton. It
is very simple. In many cases these fixtures
for framework may be covered and
trimmed in your room, in sections, and afterwards
taken to the window, where they
are easily put together. This is a wonderful
assistance in making a rapid change.</p>

<p class='c007'>These standard pieces are mostly made of
half inch wood, and are covered with black
cambric or painted. They are light in
weight, strong and durable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each piece represents a useful stand in
itself, and there is no limit to the variety
of designs obtainable. The following is a
brief description of the pieces:</p>

<p class='c007'>Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on the first illustration
are pedestals (or boxes). The size of
smallest is one foot square (or a cube).
The second size is one foot square and two
feet high. The largest size is one foot
square and three feet high.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 4 is a circle, two feet six inches in
diameter, and made of 1-inch board.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 5 is a half circular stand, three feet
high and one foot six inches in diameter,
and covered with heavy paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 6 is what I call a cap. It measures
one foot square at small end, three feet
square at large end, and one foot six inches
deep. It is a good fixture for laces, embroideries
or notions.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 7 is a 1-inch pine board, one foot
wide and eight feet long, or any length
suitable for the window to be trimmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 8 is a round pillar, eight inches in
diameter, and three feet six inches high.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 9 is a cap, eight inches in diameter
at bottom, twelve inches at top, and ten
inches high.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 10 is three half circles, each made
one foot square, and boxed in, the small
one measuring three feet six inches in
diameter (outside measurement). The second
one is five feet six inches in diameter,
and the largest half circle seven feet six
inches in diameter.</p>

<p class='c007'>No. 11 is a half circle box, one foot high
and two feet in diameter. The pyramid is
one foot square at the base, and two feet
high.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second illustration shows a few devices,
made of ½-inch wood, and measure
about three feet high, and will suggest
themselves for showing many lines, such as
notions, jewelry, cutlery, hardware, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other illustrations give you a few examples
of the many designs obtainable from
this modern combination fixture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another set of standard pieces which has
been quite largely used and is recommended
by many decorators, is illustrated
below.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first illustration shows how to make
pillars, stands, etc. They will need little
explanation, but I will mention, for example,
that A is made from two circular pieces
of wood, 1, joined together by strips of
wood, or lath. These circular pieces are
very useful. The cone, C, is made by connecting
the pieces 5 and 3 by strips or lath.
D is a standard having 3 for its top. F is
a useful stand employing the pieces 1 to 5
connected by short standards.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing is important. Do not use
nails larger than is necessary to hold the
structure together. Many novices spike
their pieces together as firmly as if they
were to endure to the end of time, and the
consequence is that many pieces are broken
and destroyed in taking the framework
apart. Temporary security is all that is required,
and by the exercise of a little care
the frames will last for years.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c008'>HARMONY OF COLORS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After erecting the framework the decorator
proceeds to cover it, in order to complete
his background. But before doing
this the harmony of color must be considered,
as the real success of his window will
depend upon the good taste and arrangement
of the colors employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>No man need be frightened at facing this
frequent bugbear to the novice:—color harmony.
Any one will readily understand it
after reading this chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is color?” you ask.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing but common daylight deprived
of some of its wonderful properties.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this is understood the subject is
robbed of its terrors, for we know we are
facing a natural effect, and nature is simplicity
itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>When light strikes any object, such as
a blade of grass or leaf, the rays of white
light are separated or decomposed; part
are absorbed by the grass or leaf and the
others reflected to the eye, causing the sensation
of color; in this case green, the grass
or leaf having reflected the blue and yellow
rays and absorbed the red. To understand
this thoroughly a little scientific experiment
will demonstrate clearly. Go into a dark
room, shutters, doors, etc., closed tight.
Now make a very small hole through a
shutter to the outer daylight, when a fine
pencil of light will penetrate the darkness.
Into this ray of light place a prism of glass,
when the ray, after passing through the
prism, will be diverged and separated,
showing the solar spectrum in all its beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The colors thus shown are the elementary
colors of white light, commonly called
the “primary” colors. The red, blue, and
yellow are the most dominant in the spectrum,
and in consequence always understood
when we speak of “primary” colors;
the intermediate rays shade into the various
colors of the spectrum and are called “complimentary
colors.” They show all the
tints of the rainbow, which is in fact a gigantic
solar spectrum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blade of grass has appropriated the
red rays of the spectrum (or light) and
leaves us only the blue and yellow, which,
being reflected and blended, give us the
sensation of green instead of white.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every color affects the eye (or optic
nerve) with a different vibration, which
enables the optic nerve to inform the brain
of the color. In this way we get the sensation
of color. Black is the absence of all
color; that is to say, it absorbs all the rays
and returns none. White is the reflection
of all the rays, none being absorbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “primary colors,” red, blue, and yellow,
have their “secondary colors,” which
is the combination of any two primaries;
as a mixture of blue and red make purple,
the complementary (or contrast) of yellow,
blue and yellow make green, which makes
red the complementary or contrast. Yellow
and red make orange, the complementary
of blue. The secondary colors are
therefore purple, green and orange.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tertiary colors are those obtained by
a mixture of all the primary colors (one
proportion of which produces black), making
what are called “broken tones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “secondary colors,” produced as
above, make the perfect contrast or complementary
colors of the primary set, and
the “tertiary colors,” or “broken tones,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>produced as above, enable us to carry out
harmony effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>No harmony of color is perfect unless it
contains all three primaries in some proportion
or other. Thus, green (blue and
yellow) and red are correct, having the
three primaries in the composition. For
simplicity I will not go into shades, which
are simply lighter tints of the primary colors;
but I may add that in harmony of
color the color value or intensity of the
shades must be carefully noted, to be effective;
that is, a brilliant orange (red and
yellow) will not be complementary to light
blue, but would be correct with blue of
same intensity. All the innumerable shades
or tones are produced from the three primary
colors, by reducing the strength of
tint; that is, making it lighter, and the
tones are produced by admixture of black,
etc., or, rather, the admixture of the three
primary colors, in different proportions,
lowering the tone, and making lighter.
Thus all the shades are made, each having
its proper complementary color or contrast.</p>

<p class='c007'>All colors, when brought into close proximity,
affect each other by reflection or absorption,
and the nearer they are in tone the
more they will suffer. The difference in
tone should be considerable, or a neutral
line of black, white or gray placed between
them; otherwise you have reds in proximity
to blue appearing yellow, the complementary
of red and blue. Red in proximity
to green (its complementary) is purer
and brighter. Red in proximity to black
becomes duller. Red in proximity to white
appears lighter (pink). Red in proximity
to gray becomes brighter; so that the same
red will appear of different shades according
to its arrangement with regard to other
colors adjacent. The same law governs the
arrangement of all colors. If red and white
are placed in contact, the white becomes
tinged with the complementary of red
(green), and the red appears deeper and
brighter. White placed beside a color
strengthens its tone. Black dulls it. Black
surfaces appear faintly tinted with the complementary
of the adjacent color, because
of its low reflective power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Black and white are commonly said to be
complementary to each other, and to harmonize
with all the other colors.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE WINDOW.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Our first consideration is the background.
White is too harsh for general
work, but is good when the window is so
dark that it makes much glare and reflection.
In this case it will heighten the
light, render the display more distinct, and
assist in avoiding reflections. Black (flat
or gloss) painting of the interior, or a black
cloth background, is objectionable because
it makes the window a veritable “camera
obscura” and reflects everything. It also
renders the colors of the goods dull or
broken. Something between white and
black will therefore be found better, such
as a warm French gray (if painted, flat of
course), not light enough to appear nearly
white, but as nearly “neutral” as possible.
A background like this will brighten up
most colors to some extent, and will not interfere
with any adjacent color. It also assists
in avoiding reflections and glare.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the arrangement of your window there
are two points to keep in mind, the “near
view,” which takes in only one window, or
part of it, and the “further view,” which will
embrace the entire trim, making all the windows
as one. In the front part of the window
take care of the harmony, or contrast,
and only use such colors as are not a light
shade of compound color, such as lavender,
etc., which are easily faded. For the second
row arrange it so that when viewed
over or between it and the first row, you
get a proper contrast, harmony or broken
tone, that will act as a “neutral” and avoid
“killing” the three colors at once. The arrangement
by contrast is usually the best
and easiest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “further view” should not have any
startling color effect at one end, and nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to balance it at the other, but should
have a similar effect of harmony or color.
When the center is of lower or broken
tones, usually esteemed neutral, or if there
be three color effects, make them one of
harmony and two of contrast, or vice versa.
Relieve them with neutral colors, and add a
touch of ribbon, flowers, etc., of the complementary
neutral, to arrest the eye a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>To decide the color of a fabric, study
what colors it is composed of. Then it becomes
easy to find the complementary.
For instance, a fabric of dull green
(broken tone) with an allover pattern of
black, covering 25 per cent of the surface
will amount to very dull green; but if the
black covers 75 per cent of the surface, it
will be a greenish black, although the green
will appear more prominent than it really
is, the black being non-luminous, or a poor
reflector.</p>

<p class='c007'>In light shades care must be taken to
define the color, as pink, yellow or rose
cast, light blue, green or purple cast. Inattention
to this will mar the color effect, as
the complementary selected will most likely
be incorrect.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well always to remember that there
are but three primary or elementary colors
(red, yellow and blue-green), and that there
cannot be harmony of color arrangement if
either one is wanting. Also that the distinction
of harmony depends on the predominance
of one, and the subordination of
the other two.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A COLOR CHART.</h3>

<p class='c010'>In order to be sure that your color combinations
are harmonious, the accompanying
diagram of a “color scheme” will be a
safe guide. Color combinations are governed
by set laws, and, as is the case with
all other natural laws, it is both foolish and
disastrous to ignore them. The center of
the chart is white, for white harmonizes
with any color. The most distinct combinations
are found by consulting the extremities
of each straight line, whether dotted
or plain. But every dotted line will harmonize
with every other dotted line as well,
and these are the combinations of strong
colors. The triangle connects the three
basic colors, blue, red and yellow, which
are distinct contrasts. The other plain
lines show the tints which harmonize together,
but not with strong colors. If ever
in doubt as to a suitable combination, consult
the chart. By following the directions
of its lines you cannot fail to be right.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>MATCHING CHART.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The following color chart is used by
some trimmers for matching colors. As already
explained, the modern window calls
for a variety of colorings, and it is in the
matching of these colors, such as the compound
shades, drabs, buffs, sages, with their
different hues, that considerable work and
patience is called for. With such colors as
these a number of points are to be considered
before a definite conclusion can be
obtained. Some of the shades, for example,
are very sensitive to the various qualities of
daylight. A dark, cloudy day, a sunny,
bright day, a hazy day, etc., all have their
effect upon the colorings in the window design.
There are other conditions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>come in to interfere with the proposed color
adjustment of the window trimmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colors may appear so and so to the eye
when placed in the design with certain
other colors. A blue setting, for instance,
may match each other if the combination
includes several shades of blue. When the
design is placed in its place in the window,
alongside of a yellow, for example, the yellow
offsets certain of the blue shades, producing
tints of a yellowish green of some
of the blues, while blueish greens are developed
in others. This, of course, disorders
the proposed color plan and the result
is discouraging unless it is known how to
overcome or avoid such troubles. Furthermore,
certain colors which match by
daylight are made quite the reverse as soon
as the electric light or the gas light is
turned on in the window. All this is perplexing
to the window artist, but there are
remedies. Use charts 1, 2 and 3. In the
first are the standard color chart line, A,
B, C, D, E, F, G and H. These represent
the color lines of the solar spectrum. Along
the side of the chart are figures 1, 2 and 3.
The first indicates the absorption spectrum
of yellow color. By following the chart
lines it will be seen that this yellow absorbs
violet and blue, while it transmits red, green
and yellow. In 2 we can see that the blue
which this division represents absorbs
orange red, yellow green and yellow, and
transmits blue, violet and part of the green.
Division 3 represents green, which results
as a combination of the two former divisions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Fig. 2 is a chart for representing the
absorption of ruby glass and a single green
shade. In this it can be seen that division
1 involves transmission of the red in A to
the orange red in C, and the remaining colors
are absorbed. In 2 is an absorption of
all the colors except green, yellow green,
blue and blue violet. In 3 is the result of
combining the colors, in which case this setting
permits no rays to pass, resulting in
full black or darkness. In chart 3 is another
plan for color setting in which 1 indicates
the absorption spectrum of yellow, 2
in which violet shows the absorption in yellow
and yellow green, 3 the compound of
green rays with the absorption of the remainder
of the spectrum.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c009'>AN EYE FOR COLORS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A window trimmer who has an eye for
color is usually able to group colors quite
satisfactorily without the assistance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>charts and regulations, but there are very
few who possess the qualification, although
perhaps many think they do. The reason
that many suppose this is because the color
plan of their window is pleasing to their own
eyes, though it may be distasteful to others.
Hence the necessity of applying to
color charts, etc., to avoid discords to the
eye of the practiced colorist. If you seek to
produce white light from any of the color
rays, add thereto the complementary ray.
If yellow be absorbed the resultant color
will be violet. If blue and yellow rays are
absorbed the reflected ray will be red. If
red is absorbed then we get green. If yellow
and red be absorbed the result will be
a blue. In window trimming two colors of
striped goods placed in juxtaposition will
always heighten each other’s color effect.
Suppose that two stripes of a certain color
fabric are arranged parallel with two stripes
of another color it will be seen that the
color of the four stripes differ if we look at
them from a certain distance. This is because
the coloring of the two inside stripes
serve as terms of comparison to judge the
modifications of these two interior stripes
in their juxtaposition. For example, it will
be found that red will be modified, inclining
to violet, and orange is modified inclining
to yellow, when the stripes are made up of
red and orange. If we use a combination
of blue and violet in a window design we
will find that the blue will be modified to a
greenish blue, and the violet to a reddish
color. It is a good idea to cut out some
four-inch wide strips of fabric and experiment,
before going ahead with your color
scheme.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c008'>MATERIAL FOR BACKGROUNDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Not less important than the framework
is the background and the decoration of
your framework. Indeed, many trimmers
regard the subject of backgrounds as the
most important in window trimming.
There is a distinction between framework
and background, although the frame often
constitutes the backing of a portion of your
window. Thus, a step, a table, or anything
that supports the goods, is a part of the
framework. An arch, puffed and pleated to
make up your picture, is part of your background.</p>

<p class='c007'>A background may be upholstered in any
fabric from cheesecloth to velvet, or it may
be a painted scene, or an imitation of nature,
or simply covered with wall paper, or
panelled to represent a room. It is the
frame to your picture, and all pictures cannot
be framed alike.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of fabrics, cheesecloth is most in vogue.
It is pretty, easily worked, and cheap.
Whatever color or combination is selected,
you must use to cover your floor, your
framework, and the backing wherever it is
visible from the front. It may be simply
spread over your woodwork, or pleated, or
puffed; and the same material may be used
for draperies where they are required. The
best effect is obtained by using light color
or even plain white, and edging with a
darker color that is harmonious, or a darker
shade of the same color. White goods require
a dark backing as a foil; dark goods
of all kinds require a light backing. Of
course there are exceptions. Pure white
goods are effectively shown on a backing
of cream or any other delicate tint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some people have said that cheesecloth
is not appropriate for backgrounds, and
recommended richer fabrics. A few trimmers
for large and wealthy concerns have
obtained permission to use expensive drapery
in the place of cheesecloth, and are covering
their backgrounds with plushes, raw
silks, satins and upholstery goods. These
make the windows appear rich, but not especially
attractive. They are stiff and unpliable
and must hang loosely in draping.
The risk of loss in soiling will not allow
of using light colors, and the dark shades
and figured goods soon become tame to the
spectators. They are not nearly so effective
a foil to merchandise as cheesecloth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Only the richest goods can be used with
such backgrounds, for ordinary goods
would look very cheap by comparison.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true cheesecloth is a flimsy, cheap
material, looking very coarse upon close
inspection, but it is an ideal cloth for decorations.
It lends itself to puffing, pleating
and all modes of draping with great pliability.
It is made in every tint and color.
It has a way of rendering itself unobtrusive
while serving as a capital foil for almost any
grade of merchandise. And it is cheap.
Find any other material which has these
qualifications, and trimmers will readily
adopt it. Many houses cannot afford more
expensive material. Cheesecloth has figured
prominently in the evolution of show
windows. Had merchants been forced to
adopt a more expensive material for backgrounds
and floor coverings, it is probable
that many of them would not be decorating
their windows even to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, its bright and varied colorings allow
of many combinations and perfect harmony.
It makes a window attractive
enough to stop pedestrians, who, glancing
at the display, unconsciously note that the
goods on exhibition are thrown prominently
into the foreground, while the coloring
that made them pause has modestly retired,
and serves only as a foil for the articles of
merchandise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jewelry, bric-a-brac and silverware assuredly
need a richer background to display
them harmoniously; but cheesecloth is appropriate
for nine-tenths of the window
trims throughout the country, and there is
absolutely nothing to take its place.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FIREPROOF DECORATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Not infrequently we hear of a bad fire occasioned
by draperies or decorations catching
from a lighted match or other similar
cause, the inflammable nature of the material
used causing a rapid spread of flames
and consequent damage to property.
Whether this occasions great loss of life,
as was the case at the great bazaar in Paris,
or is a minor blaze, such as often occurs in
a window when a lighted gas jet approaches
too near the trimmings, such accidents are
desirable to avoid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite recently a method has been discovered
of treating material used to decorate
halls, booths and windows, which
absolutely precludes the possibility of a
blaze. The material is simply dipped into a
solution of tungstate of soda and allowed
to dry. Bunting, cheesecloth and other
material so treated are slow burning when
ignited, and never blaze up. Therefore they
are easily extinguished and cannot readily
set fire to woodwork or other substances.
No hall or booth where people congregate
should be decorated without using this simple
and effective precaution against fire, and
all loss in a show window may be avoided
in like manner. The solution does not injure
the fabric.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c008'>PLANNING A WINDOW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are two ways to plan a window.
One is to draw on paper a diagram of your
framework and lay out your plan as carefully
as an architect will design a house.
Another is to plan as you build, and gradually
add to your window until it is completely
trimmed. Both ways are practiced
by the best trimmers, and each method has
been defended by its votaries as the best.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first thought it would seem best to
make a plan of your window, but sometimes
it will not look as well when completed
as the plan would seem to indicate.
And, again, if you build up a window without
any forethought, it is just as liable to
be a disappointment as a success. Perhaps
it is best to have some plan formulated if
only in your mind, and then work as closely
to it as your window and your material will
allow. If you see a chance to improve it
as you work, you may easily do so. Often
I have carefully thought out a window, and,
after fairly starting, changed its plan by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>degrees until it was totally different from
what I had first intended.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a symmetrical window a centerpiece
is always necessary. It may be an arch, a
pair of steps, a circular recess, or whatever
you choose, but the center is always the
most important point of your trim. Good
windows are sometimes made by building
out the sides uniformly and drawing them
toward the center, but it requires much
skill to do this successfully, and even then
you cannot ignore the center, where the eye
of the observer rests first and most frequently.
This is the reason a small window
is often as effective as a large one. A
large window can, of course, show more
goods and more detail, but all this is accessory
to the centerpiece, and the main
idea of any big window can always be reproduced
in a smaller one by leaving out
some of the details and accessories, and,
perhaps, reducing the size of the centerpiece.
Circles or sections of circles are
best for frameworks, as nothing is so graceful
as a circle. Squares, triangles, etc.,
are stiff as compared to circles, and are
difficult to trim. Even steps, or series of
shelving, are best made in circular form.
Pillars are useful in many ways. They
support arches or platforms, and may be
used independently for many lines of goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aim to have the heaviest part of your
trim in the center. The extreme sides, or
ends, of your window may be next heaviest
or fullest. Between the center and the
ends the trim should be lightest; but this
depends considerably on the shape of your
window and the character of the trim. If
you have no judgment don’t attempt to
trim windows. Aside from an artistic eye
and deft workmanship the only other requisite
of a successful trimmer is common
sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not place your trim too near the window
pane, as it destroys the effect of the
best display. Unless goods are very small
indeed they will look better the farther they
are removed from the pane. The floor
space in front of the main trim may always
be utilized to good advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, speaking of floors, I am not in
favor of what are called “floor trims” in
any line of merchandise. They do not attract
one unless he deliberately stops to
gaze into a window, and few people do that
in this busy age. Raise your trim to the
center of the window, even if it is composed
of small wares, and then it will arrest
the gaze of the passerby.</p>

<p class='c007'>The suggestions I have offered are of
necessity general in their scope, and I advise
you to study all the good windows you
may see. Don’t be content to copy them,
however, but improve upon them. Some
other man’s idea will frequently give you an
idea of your own that is vastly better. Originality
alone does not always win. It is better
to copy a good window than to originate
a poor one. And to originate a good window
is better yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the window dresser is required as
a salesman during the day, the decorating
is done late in the evening, when a screen
is not at all necessary.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c008'>SHOW WINDOW UPHOLSTERY.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>HOW TO DRAPE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Unless a window dresser is thoroughly
conversant with the art of draping he will
not be recognized as accomplished. Yet
there are many professional trimmers who,
it must be admitted, create wonders in their
line while unable to put up an effective
drape. This statement may be denied by
many trimmers, and it surely sounds rather
strange. However, I wish to argue on this
subject and shall at the same time endeavor
to give those not fully posted on the knack
of draping some practical hints and suggestions.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a man in a smaller town who takes
care of the show windows is not acquainted
with this branch of trimming, you need not
feel surprised, as he has little or no chance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to see and learn. It is naturally easier for
him to learn pleating, puffing, and to make
his wooden fixtures, than to put up an
artistic drape, simply because he can acquire
great ability and skill in these lines of work
without being instructed, while many men
will never learn how to drape until they are
shown how to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Draping is the foundation of the art of
window trimming.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no window in which some kind
of a drape could not be applied to good
advantage. It gives the window an artistic
and pleasing effect and is always appropriate.
Draping is as old as the history of
decorating itself, and it will never become
old fashioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the prettiest and most artistic
effects are produced by draping, it is simple
in itself, and, as in some tricks, “easy if
you know how.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PLAIN FESTOON DRAPERY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>One edge of the fabric is first pinned
along the line to be draped, the distance
being spaced equally, and it is an advantage
to have little wooden spindles projecting
a few inches, where each rosette
would come, so that the material hangs
clear of the wall instead of flat against it.
Whatever the distance is between the
pins, two or three times the same length
of cloth should be allowed to make the festoon.
About eight or ten inches below the
pin the material is tied together tightly
with a piece of string, the surplus material
thus gathered together being for the purpose
of forming the rosette. Removing the
pin, the cloth is lifted up and the pin inserted
at the same place again, but in such a
way as to hold the fabric just where the
knot was tied. Tacks may be more easily
managed than pins. The rosette finally almost
forms itself, as the bunch of surplus
fabric is simply turned inside out, and pulled
or patted into shape. The process is quite
simple, and should be clearly understood
by an inspection of the drawing, which
shows at one end the fabric pinned up; the
next loop has the string tied around it, and
the third is finished with a neat rosette, the
folds of the fabric hanging in a graceful
cascade.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Quite recently a drapery hook has been
invented which forms the rosettes automatically,
thus simplifying the above process.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>COMBINATION DRAPERY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The drape shown in the first illustration
consists of cheesecloth and is constructed
in the following way: Take a thin bendable
strip of wood, perhaps ¼ to ⅛ by 1½ inch,
fix the lengths according to the size of your
window, puff it with cheesecloth, bend it
into the shape of a semi-circle, and place
it in the center of your window. You may
place it horizontally, vertically or slanting,
to suit your fancy. If your window measures
3 yards, take from 9 to 12 yards of
cheesecloth and allow 1 to 2 yards extra on
each side to hang down. The festoons as
shown in the sketch require about 3½
times as much cloth as the distance from
one rosette to the next one. If you desire
to drape deeper, allow about four times as
much cloth instead of 3 or 3½ times as
much for the festoons. Take the piece of
cloth, divide it in two equal parts and pin
it up at the middle by the edge, on the center
of the semi-circle. After this form the
festoons one after the other, one to right
and one to left. The rosettes are made in
this manner: After the cloth is pinned up
and divided as indicated, take hold of it at
about one foot below the pins, fold it into
many pleats, each about 1½ inch wide, lift
the cloth up to the pin and drive a second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>pin through the pleats, thus pinning
it against the background. This leaves a
bunch of cloth for the rosette, which you
turn inside out, pull it apart and form it into
the shape of a rose. After you have made
the second rosette the festoon has formed
itself almost to perfection, and if not your
fingers must help out and complete the process
by pulling and pushing the folds into
proper shape, which is then easily done.
The other part of the drape in our first
sketch is like the one No. 3, and will be
treated later. The sections No. 1<i>a</i> and No.
1<i>b</i> are made of separate pieces of cloth
thrown over a short piece of curtain pole,
which is projected about a foot from the
background. These sections are more
adaptable to silk drapery and require a
square piece of very wide cloth, not narrower
than 36 inches. To construct No. 1<i>a</i>
this piece of cloth is laid upon the counter
in diamond shape—like a napkin—and the
cloth turned over from either end into wide
pleats to and fro until the extreme points
are thus folded. No. 1b is the same with
the only difference that the diamond shaped
piece of cloth is folded or cut into triangle
shape and folded only from one side. These
pieces, thus prepared, are folded again in
the middle and thrown over the fixture,
showing only one-half of their entire length.
If you wish to have them reach down lower
take a longer piece of cloth, cut the ends
into diamond or triangle shape and proceed
the same way. The effect of this style of
draping is greatly increased by trimming
the edges with tassels or fringes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_026.jpg' alt='No. 1<sup>a</sup>' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Drape No. 2 is one of the most effective,
and consists of two pieces of cheesecloth,
silkaline or light silk. Two contrasting but
harmonizing colors are very desirable. It is
the plain festoon and rosette drape projected
from the wall by heavy knitting
needles. These you drive in first and start
with pinning up your cloth at one end
(right end first) and continue with it until
the left end is reached. When commencing
with the second bolt of cloth do not unroll
any more of it at the time than necessary
to push the bolt alternately through the
loops of the first piece. After you have thus
covered your background, proceed to form
the rosettes; pull, push and pat the folds
of the drape into proper shape and you
have produced a pretty and artistic effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drape No. 3 can only be constructed
with heavy plush-velour or rich drapery silk
or any goods with two right sides—as both
sides are shown—unless you cut the goods.
It consists, like No. 2, of two pieces, and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>endless variety of different designs may be
formed with this style of drapery. The
sections No. 1a and No. 1b are very appropriate
with this drape, and separate rosettes,
heavy silk cords, tassels and fringes will
greatly enrich it. To put up this drape requires
more skill and taste than the former
two, as, unless it is executed to perfection
it is unattractive. Throw your goods over
a curtain pole projected from the background
and let the first end drop down to
the floor. Then fold the goods carefully into
about 4 to 7 folds and form the loops as
shown in illustration without ever letting
the folds become uneven or irregular, something
which is more difficult to avoid than
the sketch exposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>All in all, draping is easily learned, and
no ambitious amateur will rest until he has
acquired full ability to put up an artistic
drape.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOW TO PUFF.</h3>

<p class='c010'>It will take about four times the length
and width of cloth to puff any given space.
If your background is 12 feet long and 3
feet wide it will require four strips each a
yard wide and 48 feet long. Very coarse
puffing may be made by using as little as
three times the amount of cloth that will
cover the space, but for puffing such as is
shown in our illustration four times the
amount is required.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_027a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There are two ways to puff. For large
spaces it is quicker and cheaper to cover the
backing with bookbinder’s paste, and puff
upon that. Always begin at the left-hand
upper corner. Turn the edge of your cloth,
to start with for,
raw edges always
look badly. Support
the cloth with
your right hand,
and with the left
spread out your
thumb and fingers
and claw the cloth
together into an irregular
puffed effect.
Do not be
too particular
about each handful—the
total effect
will be all right.
Work quickly and your puffing will be more
uniform than when done cautiously and
slowly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_027b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If you are not covering a very large space
it is best to pin your puffing. Start the
same as directed for pasted puffing. Fasten
a small pincushion, well covered with pins,
to your vest, and use a small upholsterer’s
hammer to tack with. Keep the hammer
in your right hand. Push up the cloth and
pin it, driving the pin in lightly with your
hammer. Be sure to puff close enough to
hide the pins.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PUFFING FOR HEADINGS AND ORNAMENTAL DESIGNS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>First take cloth or bunting, fold into
9-inch strips, fasten end to wall or counter
by small wire nail (with head filed
off and pointed), take other end, pull tight
and fasten at first; next take sharp knife
or scissors (knife preferable) and cut
along folds to end. (This will give you
a straight, clean edge.) Take 9-inch
strips, pleat into small pleats and fasten
as in beginning, step back eight or ten feet,
place pin into pleats, then start at beginning
or end and pin every five or six inches
apart and so on full length of cloth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>This may be made day previous to using
in window. Now to apply it to design,
start at right hand corner and tack pins
every three inches apart, or according to
size of puffs desired, continue until all is
on, then start at beginning and pull out
puffs. When completed you will find that
your puffs are even and of a uniform size,
and the time taken will be a great deal less
than anticipated.</p>

<p class='c007'>This puffing can be used on every shaped
design imaginable and with very best of
results.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE SHOGRAN PUFFING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This wonderfully popular and useful
puffing is named after its inventor, Leonard
Shogran.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_028a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I feel confident the usefulness and labor
saving qualities of this idea, together with
the neat and artistic effect which can be obtained
by its use, will be appreciated by
all my readers. In connection herewith I
wish to state, that the value and usefulness
of this decorating device is becoming so
pronounced that many decorators have begun
to use it almost exclusively to give a
finished effect to their decorations, where
cheesecloth is used. The reason of this
popularity is no doubt due to the fact that
with it a display can be beautifully finished
in one-tenth the time consumed in puffing
the old way.</p>

<p class='c007'>This puffing is the result of a great deal
of scheming as to how to lessen the time
and labor in finishing up a job of cheesecloth
work. It is generally done by taking
the cheesecloth loosely in the hand and pinning
or tacking it in position, representing
small rosettes, the tiresome and tedious
operation of which every window trimmer
will admit.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_028b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>I have used this puffing with telling effect
in building booths and floats and decorating
halls, etc. In short, it has become
an indispensable article with me, as well as
all who have learned to use it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In preparing this puffing, tear a length
of ten-cent cheesecloth into eight strips
or, if wider puffing is desired, tear it into
six strips, according to width wanted. Sew
them into tubes, or what I would call long
sleeves, and turn them on a thin stick or
rod, so the ragged edges will be on the inside.
Then full them over a strip of muslin
about one and one-half inches wide, and
thus the article is made.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_028c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>If you wish to use it in covering the ragged
edge of some pleated work, where tacks
and pins are usually in plain view, fasten
one end of the muslin strip at a point where
you intend to begin, then draw the puffing
back about two feet from where you fastened
the muslin; then we draw the puffing
over it nicely, not too full, and fasten the
puffed part in place; next, draw the surplus
puffing back another two feet, and repeat
the operation; and so on until finished. An
illustration of this will be found in the accompanying
sketches. Should the strip of
muslin prove too short, pin another to it,
and draw the puffing over. The sketches
will give an idea of how easily it can be
draped and festooned, or worked into any
artistic scroll or design the inventive mind
of a decorator may dictate.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Decorators who try this idea will be surprised
to see how quickly the goods can be
made and applied. The seam is sewn very
rapidly on a sewing machine, and it is a
pleasure to work with this ever ready and
very pliable material.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>EDGES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Pleated backgrounds with puffed edges
are very popular. To puff an edge use
about one-third or one-half the width of
your material, and puff and pin as before
directed, taking care to turn under all the
raw edges, or better yet, use the Shogran
puffing.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is upon the market a prepared puffing
of colored and white cheesecloth, sewn
upon strips of heavy paper. It is sold at a
small advance over the cost of raw material.
When you wish to put in a window in a
hurry this prepared puffing is valuable; but
I advise everyone to learn the art of puffing,
for only by being able to do all the detail
work yourself can you become a successful
trimmer, and wholly independent of the supply
houses.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TO MAKE SUNBURSTS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A “Sunburst” is the effect created by a
form of pleating<a id='t33'></a> radiating in all directions
from a central point.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sunbursts, while they look difficult to
make, are comparatively easy. It matters
not what shape you wish to construct,
whether round or square, the system is always
the same. First measure your outside
edge of frame, then cut off your strips
of cheesecloth the different lengths required,
pleat in center of them all and tie firmly
with string, nailing them to the center
of the frame. Then stretch them to the
outer edge of the frame.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SMOCKING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>One of the prettiest effects in backgrounds
is made by “smocking,” or catching the material
into little squares, as is shown in the
illustration. I have used this method in
many windows, and always with good success.
For paneling, pillars, etc., it will be
found very desirable and attractive.</p>

<p class='c007'>First cut your goods one-fifth larger than
the space you wish to cover, sewing breadths
neatly together. Then lay the cloth in even
folds, and on each fold make dots with
colored chalk or pencil, to show where the
squares are to be caught up. These squares
show plainly in the picture. They should
be caught together with a needle and thread
of a color to match the cloth. If the work
is neatly done it will more than repay you
for your trouble; and, indeed, once you have
caught the knack of doing it, you will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>it easy and quick work. So little material
is used that it is the least expensive of any
fancy background. I generally use bleached
muslin, but the light shades of bunting or
surah silk are equally adaptable.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c009'>HOW TO PLEAT.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Pleating is more of a trick than it appears
to the uninitiated. Good pleating is very
beautiful, but poor pleating is worse than
none at all. The secret of good pleating is
uniformity.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will acknowledge that pleating was one
of the most difficult things for me to learn;
but I finally invented a little scheme that
assisted me wonderfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was nothing more or less than a
clothespin, but it accomplished the work accurately.
Start at the left-hand upper corner,
first turning under the raw edge. Then
place the slot of the clothespin over the edge
and turn it half around to the right. Place
your finger against the fold thus made, pull
out your clothespin and tack or pin in place.
Move your clothespin a given distance to
the right, turn again and pin as before. The
pleating will be absolutely uniform. In
single pleating the folds are all one way;
box pleating is made by turning first to the
right, then to the left, as in illustration.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SINGLE PLEATING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If you have a good eye for distances you
won’t need the clothespin, but beginners
may use it to good advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where you have a pleated background
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the edges of your framework may also be
pleated closely, and then, say every six
inches, pull out the pleating into the form
of a rosette. The effect is very pretty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='c008'>THE BACKGROUND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A good background is a necessity. It
is the frame of your picture. Many goods,
desirable in themselves, need a color effect
to throw them out properly. Practical window
trimmers devote much study to designing
their backgrounds, frequently relying
upon them to arrest the eye of the passing
throng and so direct attention to the goods
themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>No matter how artistic a window display
may be, it loses more than half its attraction
if not suitably backed. The background
affords relief to the trim, and is
as necessary as the scenery to a stage
setting or the sky line to a landscape. It
completes your picture, and, frequently, attracts
the eye sooner than the goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore too much attention cannot be
given backgrounds, and were there a school
of window trimming, the proper use of the
background would be one of the first
things taught.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>STOCK BACKGROUNDS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Many trimmers construct their backgrounds
in the windows, which takes considerable
time, and when completed, they
hurry in the goods to be shown, not giving
themselves time to show them properly, feeling
they have spent too much time on the
background. Consequently, the window
is not what it should be. To obviate this
I would advise the using of portable stock
backgrounds. They are not expensive, and
are easily constructed. The time saved in
trimming a window is a very important factor.
A few frames made of light strips,
covered with cheap muslin, forms an excellent
groundwork. They can be decorated
with cheesecloth in sunbursts, pleating—or,
in fact, there is no limit to the variety
of ways to treat them. The frames can be
made in convenient sizes to fit your windows,
so that they can be easily handled and
put together quickly in the window. Both
sides of the frames should be decorated, so
that after you have used one you can turn
your frame, showing a different style and
color entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'>These backgrounds are also to be commended
as examples of good taste and elegance
of design without being elaborately
ornate. A very great mistake is not infrequently
made in trying to gain a great effect
by using an overdone and complicated
background which results in distracting the
eye from the rest of the display, just as an
extremely simple and beautiful picture is
often killed because it has been put into a
huge gilded Rococo frame.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are almost countless materials
which may be used in making backgrounds,
which will give just the finishing touch
needed to complete a harmonious window;
for instance, Japanese Grass Cloth, which
can be procured from most of the large wall
paper houses. This is a combination of
thread and fine straw, woven together, and
backed with tough paper. It comes in just
the colors which will harmonize with any
other color without predomination,—rich
olive green and golden browns, or even
beautiful dull reds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Oriental mattings and cloths of
unique weave and pattern may also be used.</p>

<p class='c007'>The accompanying plates illustrate how
quickly these backgrounds can be put together.</p>

or wood ornaments obtained from
almost any saw mill at a little cost. A plain
box with blocks nailed top and bottom, covered
with cloth in any color desired, with a
panel of gilt picture moldings, makes a good
pedestal.</p>

A plain cap can be used instead of the fancy
ones, either square or round, with a band
of lincrusta to match the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>These backgrounds can be produced at
little cost, and are a great help to the trimmer
who has many windows. With a little
ingenuity and adaptation one can form an
endless variety of artistic backgrounds.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Where it is desirable to admit light to the
store, the window may be draped in a style
that is called “an open background.” At
the back of the window tack a width or
double width of cheesecloth or other material
to the top and bottom of the window;
not too tightly, but with slack enough to
allow for gathering at the middle, as is
shown in the illustration. It is not necessary
to pleat the material at the top and
bottom, as the gathering gives an effect of
fullness, but if a single width is used it
gives a fuller appearance when pleated.
Tie the centers together with bows of bright
ribbon. Hanging baskets of flowers and
vines suspended in the center of the spaces
add to the effect. This style of backing is
very neat, and much better than no background
at all for drug and jewelry displays.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LATTICE WORK.</h3>

<p class='c010'>For lattice work erect a light framework,
wind with cloth, and use strips of curtain
cloth, white tape or ribbon for lattice. Run
all the strips one way before you put
in the cross strips, and these should run
back of the first, before the next, and so
alternating until you have reached the end.
The next strip should reverse the order,
running before the first.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Having erected a proper framework and
covered it in an artistic manner, the background
is complete, and the decorator next
turns to the subject of proper fixtures on
which to display his goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer is a firm believer in good window
fixtures, for they assist greatly in making
a handsome display, and thus selling
goods. Therefore an adequate supply of
substantial brass and nickel fixtures is not
an extravagance, but a necessity. I said an
adequate supply. The big city store needs
a great variety of fixtures, for there are
many windows to trim. The small store
cannot afford more than enough to be used
to good advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Side brackets, or arms, must be provided
amply, and enough uprights and rods to
make whatever racks or trees may be required
for small goods. Special display
require special fixtures, and where the fixture
cannot be entirely covered, a homemade
erection would be out of place. When
a need arises for a good fixture the expense
should not be considered.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a town of 50,000 inhabitants a
merchant writes: “I can no more expect
my trimmer to create a good window without
proper fixtures than a carpenter to
make a good piece of cabinet work without
tools. Windows that will attract attention
to our goods are necessary; therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>we buy every fixture that is required.” A
firm in a town one-half the size of the above,
states: “If we were forced to choose between
inside fixtures and window fixtures
the window fixtures would get them every
time. We could sell goods off a dry goods
box when once we had brought the people
into our store; but without a good window
display we fear we could induce very few to
enter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A general merchant in a town of 5,000
writes: “I never paid any attention to my
windows until a year ago, when I instructed
one of my clerks who was going to the city,
to buy whatever fixtures we might need to
trim a window properly. To my horror he
purchased nearly $200 worth of fixtures,
including a jointed form. I felt like sending
the goods back, but, at the clerk’s earnest
solicitation, decided to keep them. To-day
I would not part with them for double the
amount they cost. My windows are talked
of all over the country, and my competitors
are making frantic efforts to imitate my
style of trimming windows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another merchant writes: “I never
bought a window fixture that did not prove
a good investment.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOMEMADE FIXTURES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The decorator more frequently finds a
lack of fixtures to be his stumbling block
than any other detail of window trimming.
Dearth of proper fixtures is more fruitful
of complaint, contention and ill feeling between
the trimmer and his employer than
all other causes combined; and, while there
are many unreasonable and “stingy” employers,
on the other hand, it may be observed
that in very many cases the more
indolent and incompetent the trimmer the
louder are his complaints; and to such a
degree does he sometimes carry this that
his colleagues become wearied of his
“hobby,” he becomes persona non grata
with his employer, resulting finally in being
driven out to make room for one with more
tact, better temper and a larger store of
latent resources, enabling him to make the
best of the, perhaps, meager supply of materials
at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did any one ever know of an incompetent
and unsuccessful trimmer who did not lay all
his troubles and failures to the lack of fixtures;
or a capable and successful one who
did not climb to the top in spite of his handicaps
of this kind? Again, there are many
ambitious young men who do make an effort
to surmount these difficulties, regarding
this as the “make-shift period,” sighing
the while for the time when they can take
their place in the great establishment, that
“promised land” where their troubles will
have ended, where there are fixtures galore
for every wrinkle, and where they must but
say, “presto, change,” and the marvelous
creations they dream about will be complete.
It is no secret with experienced men
that this state of things exists only in
dreams, for, if the great store is replete with
all the modern appliances, so, also, are the
requirements multitudinous in proportion,
and the trimmer who has failed to cultivate
to the utmost his inventive faculties while
occupying his humbler sphere cannot hope
to succeed in the greater one; and, yet
again, it has been proven that the average
store, doing a business of $100,000 a year,
is as fully equipped in the fixture line, in
proportion to volume of business done, as
is the great metropolitan establishment
whose sales run into the millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to agitate the fixture question
in every proper way with the employer, and
to try to obtain those that are necessary;
and it is well, also, to keep an eye on the
lumber pile, for with saw and hammer one
can rig up fixtures with which he can make
a creditable display of any class of merchandise,
and at the same time train himself to
become a man of resources; for, far and
away ahead of all other gifts the successful
trimmer is always resourceful, and the
ability to hastily construct necessary fixtures
is twin brother to the gift that enables a
man to handle every kind of goods given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>him in all the ways it is capable of being
displayed at short notice which is the
characteristic stamp of the true artist, and
determines his value to his employer as
well as his standing in the profession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here are one or two illustrations:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_037a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>IDEAS FOR HOMEMADE FIXTURES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If you have been asked to show underwear,
for instance, and metal fixtures are
not obtainable, don’t entertain a trimmer<a id='t41'></a>
get some curtain poles, saw into required
lengths, procure some three-pronged metal
towel racks from house furnishing department,
screw them on pole, as seen in cut,
and you have a fixture that the goods will
sufficiently cover, so that no one will guess
it was not originally manufactured for the
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make a very effective centerpiece for
a linen or handkerchief window, cut from
any old boards the shape of a vase, say
thirty-six inches high. Pad one side of this
to the shape of a vase with old papers, excelsior
or any old rubbish; cover with
muslin, then puff all over with cheesecloth;
now two feet from your dark background
stretch from floor to ceiling coarse, black
tarletan; place the flat side of vase against
this and pin your handkerchiefs or napkins
on in vine and flower effect. The tarletan
is entirely invisible and the goods have the
appearance of “growing” right out of the
vase.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make an effective and artistic arch
quickly, nail your uprights to the floor,
cover with carpet padding; over this puff,
pleat or stretch plain cheesecloth or whatever
you wish to cover it with. Now get
some flour-pail lids for caps, procure some
barrel hoops, cut out about one-third and
nail either end to the side of post caps. The
space can be filled in by puffing or pleating.</p>

<p class='c007'>These methods are shown in outline in
the above diagram.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_037b.jpg' alt='A Method of Arch Construction.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Another, more elaborate arch is made as
follows: Go to the lumber room, where
old boxes and barrels are kept, and there
are usually a saw and hammer about the
store. That’s enough. Remove the wooden
hoops carefully from your barrels, and
save the heads. If you have not enough
pieces among the boxes to serve for uprights
purchase a few 2 × 4s, and also a bundle
of lath. If you wish to make an arch,
use the 2 × 4s for uprights, run a board
across the top, and nail blocks in such a position
that by bending lath or light strips,
and nailing them to the blocks, the circle
of the arch will be formed. See illustration.
Puff cheesecloth upon cardboard or the
thin wood used for backing pictures, and
fasten it to the circle of the arch, allowing
it to run down as far as the pillow. Allow
the top board to project a trifle beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>face of the arch, and cover or puff this
edge. For the pillars take heavy carpet
paper, or roofing paper, and cut it the
length you wish the height of the pillar to
be. Cover the surface of this paper with
cloth or velvet. Then bend the paper in
cylindrical form, around the upright, fastening
at the back with brass paper fasteners.
It will have the appearance of a solid
and substantial pillar. Twine smilax or ivy
about this and you will be surprised at the
effect.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PEDESTALS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Barrel heads may be fastened together
with light strips and then nailed to the top
of an upright to form a pedestal on which
any class of goods may be displayed. The
top and standards may be closely covered
with cloth, or draped from the edge of the
top to the floor. Another way is to put a
barrel head at the top and bottom and drape
in hour-glass shape, drawing the cloth together
at the center and tying with a bow
of bright ribbon, or other material.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>By winding hoops with cheesecloth you
can use them in a variety of ways. In an
illustration is shown a suspended hoop fixture
which makes a good centerpiece. The
pins in the center, which are to hold merchandise
of various kinds—hats, bonnets,
shoes, etc.,—are pieces of broom handle
nailed to the flat of the hoop. Another
good homemade fixture is in easel form,
one-third of each hoop being cut away, as
shown in the picture. A standard with
half-hoops fastened to the sides makes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>good fixture for showing laces, furnishing
goods, etc. These are all outline drawings
and do not show the fixtures covered, but
when they are wound with cloth they present
a very neat appearance, and are certainly
useful.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOMEMADE CORSET FORM.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_039b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The country trimmer is frequently at a
loss to make a good corset window. Boxes
of goods may be piled up, to be sure, but
that requires a great deal of stock, and
never looks very well, either. A dozen
corsets, properly placed, will make an excellent
display, and will sell more goods
than a mass of rolled and boxed corsets.
Have a dozen oval pieces of 1-inch board
sawed, of a size that just fits the bust of
the corset. A corresponding number of
pieces should be made to fit the waist
measurement. Connect these two pieces by
means of a standard, and lace the corsets
lightly over this improvised form. By extending
some of the standards you can have
the real corsets of your display set up, so
that all may be plainly seen. Allow the top
of the corset to project several inches above
the bust piece, and upon the shelf thus
formed put a puffing of bright colored stuff,
or place a potted palm. For a narrow window
such a display is especially desirable,
and it may also be adapted to any shaped
window to advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the above suggestions will give
the reader ideas of utilizing the lumber
room to good advantage. In another chapter
a variety of suggestions is offered, many
of which will require more or less ingenuity
on the part of the decorator to prepare
properly.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ONYX STANDARDS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>There is a paper with surface printed in
close imitation of onyx, which is being utilized
by many window trimmers to manufacture
onyx standards upon which to display
goods. Take a round pole, three feet long
and about three inches in diameter, and
nail upon either end a 12 × 12 square of
1-inch boarding. Cover all surfaces with
the onyx paper, and set several of these
stands in the window. Over them lay suits
of clothing, pieces of dress goods, or place
upon the tops pairs of shoes or other articles.
A pretty effect is created by twining
smilax around the standards. Onyx columns
to support backgrounds may be made
in a similar way. The paper may be obtained
from any first-class stationer, and
when viewed from the sidewalk closely resembles
real onyx.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PALM STANDS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>When showing small articles in a window
effective accessories may be employed by
using draped stands of irregular heights
scattered about the window, upon each of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>which is placed a palm plant. If the stands
are draped in red or yellow they show off
the green palms to good advantage. Smilax
may be twined about the bases.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GLASS SHELVES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Have strips of single or double thick
window glass cut to the size you desire.
Place two 1-inch screw eyes in your frame
or window side, and rest the edge of the
glass upon them. Fasten the ends of two
pieces of picture cord, or chain, to the screw
eyes, draw them over the outer edge of
the glass and fasten them about a foot or
eighteen inches above the shelf. This fastening
is easily made and removed, and the
shelves will be found very substantial.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_040a.jpg' alt='DRESS GOODS STAND SILK STAND' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are almost as many ways to drape
dress goods as there are varieties of the
goods themselves, and many of them are
good ways, too. Ask any window trimmer,
no matter what experience he has had, if
he can drape dress goods, and he will answer
“certainly!” and be surprised at the
question. But how well he can drape is
another question. Whether his drapings
are modern and up-to-date is also worth investigating.
An experienced trimmer finds
himself inventing new drapings almost
daily, and these are more or less serviceable.
It is a good plan to use those methods
that commend themselves to you and
that you find you are able to reproduce
easily.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_040c.jpg' alt='SKIRT STAND' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The stands have much to do with your
success. In fact, there can be no real success
without proper fixtures. We show a
diagram of an excellent dress goods stand,
which is suitable as well for silks or almost
any class of dry goods. The frame work is
light and made of soft pine and covered
with heavy roofing paper. The measurements
are shown in the drawing. By referring
to Plate No. 1, accompanying this
article, you will find that draping No. 4 is
made on this stand. In Plate No. 2 drapings
Nos. 10, 11 and 12 are also made on
the dress goods stand. Plate No. 3 shows
six styles of drapes made over this same
stand. The illustrations are from photographs
and are so distinct that even the
novice will find little difficulty in understanding
the folds. For an “all-round”
stand I recommend this highly. It should
be made in three heights, 3 feet, 4 feet and
5 feet, and is then suitable for blankets,
comfortables, muslin underwear, tablecloths,
and many other lines. At the right of
the dress goods stand is a diagram of my
silk stand, which will be found useful where
many silks are shown. Its size renders it
especially appropriate for silk widths and
by referring to drapes Nos. 5 and 6 in
Plate No. 1, and drapes Nos. 7, 8 and 9 in
Plate No. 2, you will find examples of drapings
over this stand. The dimensions are
plainly given in the drawing.</p>

The illustration shows it perfectly and gives
the dimensions. Drapings Nos. 1, 2 and 3,
in Plate 1 are examples of the use of this
stand.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the convenience of decorators I give
herewith a number of illustrations of drapings
in common use. These need not be
described in detail, for it would be a task
well-nigh impossible. Each man must, by
practice and study, work out the various
details of draping for himself, for the graceful
folds we so often see and admire cannot
really be taught. If you ask a trimmer
what his method is for making a certain effective
draping, he will stare at you in bewilderment
and say, “Why—why, I just
give it a push here, and a twist there, and a
yank sideways—and it’s done.” As a matter
of fact, he don’t know how he does it,
any more than a painter can tell you what
particular sweep of the brush created his
masterpiece. A delicate touch—an artistic
eye; that’s about all there is to it. I show
herewith many pretty styles of drapings,
but beyond describing the materials you
must work with and giving you the pictures
to study, I can assist you no further.
But do not be discouraged; try them. A
little practice will no doubt enable you to
duplicate any of them, and then I suggest
you invent new drapings of your own, that
fit your peculiar style and taste, for dress
goods are susceptible to innumerable methods
of display.</p>

<p class='c007'>Given the proper stands, as before illustrated,
draping is not so difficult as at first
appears. In Fig. 4 I show a cylinder stand,
with an upright attached that is used for
many of the drapings that have a raised
heading. The cylinder is made from papier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>mache or heavy straw board. Some forms
are made to spread at the bottom, in the
style a woman’s dress is hung. And sometimes
a flat board, or a cross-bar is required,
as will be explained further on. For fastening
the material to the cardboard form
use artist’s tacks, as they are convenient
and do not injure the cloth. Fig. 4 (a)
shows the cylinder with an upright stick
tacked upon it to hold the puffed heading;
(b) shows the first process in draping, (c)
the second, and (d) the method of gathering
the puffing at the head. In Fig. 4 (e)
is shown the completed drape, which is both
new and highly artistic. Fig. 5 is also very
effective, and its construction may be followed
in (a) and (b), and in the full draping
(c). Fig. 6 is certainly an odd effect, and
one that is just now growing popular. The
method of gathering the fold is shown in
(a), and the result in Fig. 6 (b). Fig. 7 recently
originated in Germany, and is very
graceful and pleasing. The method may be
followed in (a) and (b) to the full draping
in (c). In Fig. 8 the pansy, fans and butterflies
are made from fancy silks arranged
at the top of draped dress goods. Of course
the colors must all harmonize. Simpler
forms of draping are those in Figs. 9, 10,
11, 12, 13 and 14, and these are all made
over cylinder form, and only skillful manipulation
is needed to enable you to duplicate
them. Figs. 15, 16, 17 and 18 are made
over a cross-bar and the folds held in place
by pins. This cross-bar may be fastened to
a simple upright standard, or you may use
a flat board, which is somewhat better. Fig.
19 shows a neat method of stacking piece
goods, the top piece being used for the puffing.
Fig. 20 is called a floor draping, and
is made up over an upright standard.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE FLEUR-DE-LIS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>1. In making this unique pattern, called
the Fleur-de-Lis, a common millinery
stand 25½ inches high is used, as seen in
Fig. 1.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>2. Nine inches from the top is fastened
a piece of silk of 8 folds, containing 1¼
yards to the fold. When this is fastened
it must be the center of the fold as seen in
Fig. 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Figure 3 shows the pattern after the
hidden end of the silk is brought over the
top of the stand and is securely fastened,
and also is made to form a girdle, so as
to cover the meeting place of top folds.</p>

the center, and 10 inches in diameter.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. From tip to tip of the farthest point
of the bottom fold is 32 inches. The width
of top fold is 13 inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Any height stand and any length silk
may be used.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LINEN DECORATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A pretty decoration may be made to accompany
a window display of linens as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Take insulated copper wire and use as a
base for stems in making flowers, thistles,
etc. The thistle being entirely new and
very attractive, I will describe the process
of making it: Cut strips of coarse
linen 1¼ inches wide and unravel each
edge until a fringe is formed ⅜ of an inch
on either side. Wind this strip about the
wire for the stems, as shown in C of the
illustration, where a part of the strip is left
unwound. For the thistles, cut strips 15
inches long and 1¾ inches wide, and unravel
one edge until a fringe 1¼ inches
deep is formed. (See A.) Fasten one end
to the stem where the thistle is to be
formed, and then roll the cloth tightly,
allowing the fringe to remain loose, as in
B. Now take white linen thread and wind
tightly around the cloth at the head of the
fringe, as shown in the completed thistle
flower. D and E show the strips of cloth
before winding.</p>

<p class='c007'>In making a fence of linens, the rails
should be wound with strips 2 inches wide,
unravelled to a depth of 1¼ inches, leaving
¾ of an inch of the plain cloth. (See F.)
The pickets are wound with another 2-inch
strip which is unraveled on either side, leaving
only ¾ of an inch in the center of the
cloth, as shown in G.</p>

<p class='c007'>These strips may be utilized in many different
ways, and many beautiful effects can
be obtained by their use. These designs
add attraction to any display of linens.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c008'>THE ART OF CARD WRITING.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Show cards, to a business man, are a
necessity. Everything depends upon the
way he advertises, and he cannot advertise
judiciously without the aid of signs. Some
one must make his signs. If his business
is on a small scale, and he cannot afford a
regular sign writer, perhaps he would like
to do it himself; or, if he hasn’t sufficient
time, why not employ a window trimmer
who can do both?</p>

<p class='c007'>A window trimmer who can make his
own tickets increases his value to his employer
and can demand more money than
one who does not; at any rate, sign writing,
as a side issue, will do no one any harm,
and very often it can be used to great advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The art of show card making can be acquired
by any one with very little teaching,
a reasonable amount of patience, and plenty
of practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not become discouraged at your first
attempt. Your card will look badly, of
course, but that is to be expected. You
cannot do good work at the first attempt—it
is impossible. Improvements will be
gradual. Each card will prove better than
the last, and with a little practice you will
be surprised at the results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were it not for the interesting variations
and numerous opportunities to display artistic
ability, card-writing would be very
monotonous; as it is, a person with the
least bit of artistic taste will find it a pleasant
occupation as well as a convenient and
profitable one.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sign maker must find where the sign is
to be used and the sizes of his lettering
must be varied according to the distance it
is to be placed from the eye of the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t attempt over originality in signs.
The majority are not familiar with signs.
They have seen only a few designs. That
which may be conventional to you, because
you study signs, will be original to the majority
of people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inaugurate a system of uniformity in
your card-writing, by which all your work
(styles of lettering, etc.), have a certain
amount of similarity.</p>

<p class='c007'>If at any time you wish to change your
styles of cards or lettering, let the new styles
appear all over the store at the same time.
It does not look well to use a mixture of
types or color; it has a tendency to confuse
the public—whereas, a system will teach
them to know your particular style of work
at a glance, and it will not only be more
readable, but will establish for you a personality.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE WORK ROOM.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The first requirement is a place to work;
then you must be equipped. It is impossible
to do justice to your work unless you
are properly fitted out. Walk around the
store until you find a suitable window, and
anchor there, provided you will be allowed,
for you will find sunlight much better than
artificial light, both for the eyes and coloring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next get a table. Tilt it forward slightly,
as in this position you will find that work
can be done better than if a level surface
were used.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_049.jpg' alt='FIGURE 2 ' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For those who will go to the small expense
of building a table, I show it in Figure
2.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h3 class='c009'>RULING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>You can use a Tee Square much more
rapidly and accurately than an ordinary
rule. The inches can be marked off on
your tee in order to center the card.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FOR LINING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Soft charcoal is the best on coated cardboard.
Should your cardboard be a little
rough, a delicate lead pencil mark will be
better. Charcoal marks on coated boards
can be easily erased with a soft piece of
cloth; or, better still, a piece of chamois.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MIXING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Use a palette knife with a flexible blade,
about ½ × 3½ inches. Find a square piece
of glass, or, not having a square piece, use
any shape you have handy. I will explain
later to what use the glass is to be put.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PAINTS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Mixing forms an important part of sign
work, which, however, is considerably lessened
of late, by reason of several manufacturers
having placed on the market prepared
colors which meet the requirements
satisfactorily. I would advise their use if
it is possible to obtain them.</p>

<p class='c007'>One very important thing is, do not use
oil paint on cardboard. It does not work
well and will cause much trouble. No experienced
marker uses oil paints, unless it
is black asphaltum to fill in and outline letters;
such as several large department stores
are using at the present time. The glossy
effect of this class of work is considered by
many to be very attractive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The drawback to this method is, the cards
require a double handling and consequently
the work is very slow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drop black, in distemper, is the cleanest
and most handy preparation for card work.
It is sold in most cities in jars containing
one pound. All that is required for making
it ready is a little dissolved gum arabic and
water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take your palette knife and mix these
thoroughly on the piece of glass, to about
the consistency of a thick paste; it will then
be ready for use.</p>

<p class='c007'>All colors can be purchased in this form.
To those who would prefer to mix their own
paint here are given a few hints on mixing.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BLACK PAINT.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Lamp-black, ground thoroughly with
water and gum arabic, a few drops of alcohol
added, will make a fairly good black.
All dry colors can be mixed in this way.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>WHITE PAINT.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Fill a tin cup about ¼ full of whiting,
thin it with water, add ½ ounce of pulverized
glue—boil slowly, continually stirring
until the glue is thoroughly dissolved; this,
when cool, will make an excellent paint for
dark boards.</p>

<p class='c007'>At another using, should you find it has
become stiff, a little heating will thin it to
the proper consistency.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>COMPOUND COLORS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The following tints can be formed by
mixing the colors as below. The shades
can be made to suit any taste by the exercise
of a little judgment in proportioning
the colors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cream—White, yellow and red.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drab—White, Prussian blue and vermillion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flesh—Lake, white and vermillion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fawn—White, stone ochre and vermillion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grey—White, Prussian blue, and very
little black.</p>

<p class='c007'>Light green—White, mixed with verdigris.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grass green—Yellow, pink, mixed with
verdigris.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pea green—White and Paris green.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dark green—Black and chrome green.</p>

<p class='c007'>Olive green—Prussian blue and yellow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jonquil—Yellow, pink and white.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lead—Prussian blue and white.</p>

<p class='c007'>Olive—Red, green, or black and yellow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pearl—Dark red mixed with violet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Purple—White, Prussian blue and vermillion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stone—White with a little spruce ochre.</p>

<p class='c007'>Straw—White and yellow.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Snuff—Yellow, sienna and red.</p>

<p class='c007'>Slate—White, black, red and blue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Steel—Cerise, Prussian blue and vermillion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Salmon—White, yellow and red.</p>

<p class='c007'>Light yellow—French yellow and white.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dark yellow—French yellow and red.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lemon yellow—Yellow pink, with Naples
yellow.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BRUSHES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Nine-tenths of the inexperienced markers
are using camels’ hair brushes, which
do not have the required elasticity for good
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much depends upon your brush. A good
sign writer cannot turn out a respectable
sign with a poor brush; therefore, a beginner
cannot expect to acquire efficiency unless
he uses the proper kinds of tools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proper kinds of brushes can be obtained
of any brush dealer. For ordinary
work, a ¾ long No. 5 brush will answer, the
cost being about 20 cents. Purchase a set
of about six assorted sizes, which will answer
for all work.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_051.jpg' alt='FIGURE 3 ' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Use great care in selecting your brushes.
See that the hairs are of an equal length
and that the ends are even when the brush
is flattened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Train your brushes flat by always using
the same two sides. Rinse them in a glass
of clean water after each using, and give
them a thorough cleansing—with soap and
water about twice a week. This will keep
them in good condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Figure 3 shows the exact sizes of a set of
brushes, which will answer for all purposes.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CARDBOARD.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Your own judgment should be sufficient
to know good cardboard. The more you
pay the better goods you get, that is, if
you deal with a reputable house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Use a pure white, heavy coated board
from 6 to 10 ply, according to the size of
the sign you are making. See that your
board is of sufficient thickness to prevent
warping. If you use frames, of course
your board need not be so heavy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colored card-boards are well enough, occasionally,
but as a rule use plain white;
people do not tire of it so easily.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LAYOUT.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The laying out of a sign requires almost
as much study as the making. It is impossible
to make a good sign if your layout
is bad. Always allow plenty of margin
to your card and do not crowd or spread
your wording.</p>

<p class='c007'>Measure off an equal distance all around
your card from the margin, and keep your
lettering within these lines.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOW TO HANDLE THE BRUSH.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The following illustrations show two
views of how to hold the brush. It is held
very similar to the ordinary position of
holding a pen or pencil, except that the
brush must be held more upright.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the brush is well rubbed in paint
(on your glass) practice holding it as shown
in the illustration. Rest your hand on your
little finger. The flat side of the brush
should be horizontal to the line. In making
the Devinne series of lettering, your horizontal
lines are always fine, while the down
strokes are heavy. To make this letter it
is unnecessary to move the brush in your
fingers, hold it firmly, and as you become
accustomed to handling it you will find that
a very little pressure while making the
heavy line will produce the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>In making solid letters of the same thickness
throughout, a little practice will enable
you to revolve the brush in your fingers
(as in making an O) so that you can
produce the curved portion of a letter the
thickness of your brush without removing
it from your card. To do this requires considerable
practice and “if at first you don’t
succeed” try several times; don’t give it
up—you may do it correctly the next attempt.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_052a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In making the rapid brush letters, hold
the flat side of the brush at the same angle
as your letter; the down strokes must be
fine, the upper and lower ones heavy. To
a beginner this style will come very easy.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SPACING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Treats of the arrangement of letters and
words at the proper distances. Good taste
requires that the letters and words should
look about the same distance apart; the
space on the line which the words occupies
should be evenly filled. If this is neglected
the lettering will look “patchy”—crowded
in one place, scattered in another.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, in making your sign, you find that
you have “run out,” do not attempt to
crowd the word or words into a limited
space, but separate them, and begin a new
line. Have all your wordings to begin and
end so that perpendicular marks can be
drawn through the first and last letters of
each line. This will give your sign a symmetrical
appearance and add greatly to the
neatness of the layout.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SHADING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>To look well, and to add to the beauty
of your work, shading must be carefully
executed in both lining and coloring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not use a dark color for shading, as
it will give the letter an appearance of bulkiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Always use a delicate tint for shade lines,
such as light grey, which gives a very
pretty tone to a sign. This shade can be
made by mixing black, white and Prussian
blue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shade on two sides only; the left side of
your perpendicular stroke and underneath
the horizontal one; or, vice versa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not crowd the shade lines into your
letter. Leave a space between them about
the thickness of the line in the letter itself.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A NEW WINDOW CARD.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_052b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The panel cards, as shown above, can be
made very artistic and appropriate for any
article you may wish to show.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the illustration, should you possess
the ability to execute a water color or pen
drawing of sufficient merit to place before
the public, well and good; otherwise, do
not attempt it; a poor drawing will not improve
your card.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the monthly trade journals can
be found any number of very artistic designs,
which may be cut out, pasted on a
card and placed in position back of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>small opening. If this is done with proper
care, it will be almost impossible to detect
the deception through the window, and
the drawing will have the appearance of
being made expressly for that card.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the larger opening, place your wording
in small, neat letters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The panels can be made any desired size—the
ones shown here are 12 × 15 outside,
the large opening is 6 × 8 inches, the small
one 4 × 8 inches.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LETTERING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Before going further into technical instructions,
it may be well to explain the
various styles of letters, and the uses for
which they are required. It is always best
to use one general style of lettering for all
your cards, as the cards thus become identified
with your establishment and form a
sort of trade mark which people quickly
recognize. What style of letter you adopt
depends much upon your own taste and the
skill and facility you acquire in making any
certain letters. While each of the styles
shown in this article has its special use,
any one of them may be adapted for your
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The letters and sample cards have all
been drawn by William Lee Jukes, who is
acknowledged one of the leading card writers
of America. He has given us every useful
style of letter known to the craft.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_053.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>DE VINNE STYLE OF LETTERING.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But bear in mind that a plain, stylish,
characteristic letter is the best—something
that people will read without noting the letter
itself, that will enable them to understand
what the card says, without stopping
to realize whether the letter itself is well or
poorly executed. That is the acme of perfection
in card writing. An illegible card
loses all its intended effect. A poorly executed
card makes people notice that it is
not well done. A fancy card calls attention
to the card itself and induces the reader to
forget what the card says. You don’t want
to show what a fancy card you are able to
execute—at least the business firm that employs
you doesn’t care a rap for your skill.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>But you do want to impress a fact concerning
your goods upon the minds of a possible
customer. Therefore, strive to make a neat
card, a modest card, and at the same time
one attractive enough to arrest the attention
and induce people to read what it says.</p>

<p class='c007'> This may appear a hard task to the novice,
but by exercising good judgment and
experimenting in various styles of lettering
you will be able to get very close to the
ideal you are seeking.</p>

<p class='c007'>The requisites of a good card are simply
these:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It must be sufficiently attractive to
be noticed, to draw the eye of the prospective
customer.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. It must be worded briefly and concisely,
so that every word counts, and you
do not say too little or too much.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. It must be so neatly and modestly
lettered that the words are impressed upon
the mind of the reader without his realizing
just how the letters are formed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having impressed this upon you I will
now describe the different styles of lettering.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>De Vinne</i> letters are shown on the preceding page.
This style of letter makes
a very neat and stylish card, and is used
extensively by department stores as a fixed
style. Although it has the appearance of
simplicity it is a very difficult letter to make
correctly, and I would advise beginners to
use a more simple style.</p>

<p class='c007'>The capitals and small letters of a rapid
brush lettering are also illustrated in the
engraving upon this page. It it is a very
neat letter, easily made, and much used
where rapid work is necessary.</p>

new face, and has lately been extensively
used for out-door advertising. The unfinished,
outlined letters will give an idea as
to the manner in which this style of letter
is made. It is well to draw the outlines
first and fill the letter in solid afterwards.</p>

efficient in this style of lettering with very

<p class='c007'><i>Block Letter</i>—The block letter is
scarcely appropriate for show cards, although
there are some occasions when you
may use it. A large window ticket or interior
sign may be made with this letter,
which is so severe and regular that it will
show distinctly a long distance. It is the
most popular of all letters for outside sign
work. By spacing off a number of squares,
according to the size of the sign you wish
to make (using a lead pencil so that the lines
may be afterwards erased), and following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>out the idea as shown in our illustration,

<p>MEDIAEVAL LETTERS.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old English Text—This style of letter is
always popular, and always has been and
always will be. It is especially suitable for
writing testimonials, diplomas, charts, etc.,
or for initials or monograms—in fact, it is
useful for a hundred and one purposes.
Most people know the letter and read it
easily, thus giving it a decided advantage
over many complex fancy letters.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MEDIAEVAL LETTERS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The mediaeval style of lettering, of which
I show an illustration, is a new face with
an old-style appearance. You will find it
a very neat letter for show cards, and often
used in connection with cards bearing illustration.
Its chief merit lies in the fact that
it is black and legible, while at the same
time it presents an antique, stylish appearance.

of fancy show card work in which
this face is used to advantage.</p>

such as “Behold our Fall Garments!”
or “Allow me to introduce you to ——,”
or “Here they are!” and similar catch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>phrases. It does not require an artist to

<p class='c010'>In the illustration of figures shown, I
have presented five distinct faces, which
may be used in connection with any style

Roman; the second Roman outlined; and
here attention should be paid to the method
of shading, that the figures may stand out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>boldly. The third line of figures is Egyptian,
the fourth antique Roman and the
fifth De Vinne. This last is the best all-round
figure you can adopt, as the De
Vinne is the best all-round letter. It is
not an easy face to make, but once mastered
will prove of inestimable benefit to
the card writer.</p>

It is intended to be used as an initial letter,

  <h3 class='c009'>FANCY CARDS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The making of a fancy card is not as difficult
as one would think.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty lies in the layout. If you
can lay out and color a card artistically,
the lettering (no matter how poorly executed)
will be offset by the artistic arrangement.
On the contrary, if these good and
bad qualities should be reversed, the good
effect would be entirely lost. You will note
a reproduction of the card reading, “Early
Spring Blossoms,” from which a fair copy
can be made. Of course in print the card
loses half its artistic value, from the fact that
the colors cannot be shown. Spring puts
one in mind of dainty blossoms, consequently
let your colorings be in harmony,
and the wording breezy and new.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>EXAMPLE OF AN ARTISTIC LAYOUT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The illustration represents a card 14 ×
18 inches (a good window size). The body
is lilac, on which is pasted a sheet of cream
water color paper, torn around the edge,
leaving a margin of two inches. After tearing
the paper so as to leave a raw edge,
touch the edge lightly with gold; then lay
out your work with light lead pencil marks.
Copy the layout shown in the illustration as
closely as possible, changing the wording
to suit. Next make a series of graceful
scrolls, taking care not to get them stiff,
using a pale lilac. Next daub on a cluster
of blossoms, using several shades of purple;
that is, mix white with the purple, until it
becomes very delicate. The wreath is of
a delicate lilac. Make letters and figures
purple, shaded with lilac.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paste paper on card, leaving space on
same so that the right hand upper corner
may be slightly curled. Tip letters slightly
on top with gold, and you will have an artistic
card.</p>

<p class='c007'>The card reading “Japanese Garden,” will
be seen ornamented entirely with Japanese
characters. It is a point to be remembered
that the decorations of a fancy card
should always be in harmony with the wording.
It is a bad art and bad policy to have
your ornaments foreign to the tone of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>card. Another illustration, “Signs,” shows
an example of an artistic layout. The same
design may be used for other purposes,
such as to advertise jewelry, laces, wall paper
or any decorative goods. But you will
see at a glance it would be inappropriate
for teas, soaps or flatirons.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_064a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The alphabet illustrated is called an antique
Roman face. It is an excellent show
card style, rather irregular, neat and easily
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will notice that I illustrate some examples
of artistic layouts. These will form
the basis for fancy show cards, and serve
to attract attention. When designs of so
elaborate a character are used the letters
themselves should be especially plain and
distinct.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_064b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A “sign shop” is an important requisite
of a department store, and to establish one
in the proper way requires no little skill and
judgment. Difficulties and disputes are
continually arising between the painter and
the heads of departments, which render it
necessary to run the sign shop on a strictly
systematic basis, in order that the signwriter
may do justice to his work.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE DEPARTMENT STORE SIGN SHOP.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Jukes writes as follows concerning
department store sign shops:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_064c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I will point out a few of the difficulties
I have found, and the way they may be
overcome. For instance, one morning I arrived
at the store during the busy season
and found, to my surprise, no less than six
individuals (from cash boys up), each of
whom possessed a scrap of paper, which
they forthwith fluttered in my face. I will
not attempt to write the orders, instructions,
threats, etc., that I underwent. Suffice
to say, that each one insisted on his
signs being made immediately, and all had
been instructed to wait for them.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_064d.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>SOME NOVELTIES IN PRICE TICKETS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Now, roughly figuring on the six orders,
I found that it would take at least four
hours to get the work out. This is but one
example of the many little worries which
tend to make up the everyday troubles of
a department store sign writer. I therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>believe that it is absolutely necessary to run
the shop under rules, an outline of which
follows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Write up an order form and have printed
and tableted, as our illustration shows.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_065a.jpg' alt='CARD SIGN ORDER.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Scraps of paper are very easily mislaid or
lost, and you will find an order blank of the
below description a very necessary acquisition
to your shop. Charging the cards to
their respective departments will teach your
customers to be caretaking, hence your
work will be considerably lessened. The
cause is obvious.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to make it a standing rule that
no one should wait while signs are being
made. This rule may be easily enforced
by a promise of their prompt delivery when
completed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Signs should be made according to the
order in which they are received; that is,
every one should wait his or her turn.
This rule need not apply to window tickets.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make a sign for your shop to be read as below
and after having signed by some one
in authority, hang it in a conspicuous place
and conform rigidly to its rules.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>RULE I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>All orders must be written on the order
blank provided for that purpose and approved
by the head of the department.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>RULE II.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Sale sign orders must be in the sign shop
at least four hours in advance of sale.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>RULE III.</h3>

<p class='c010'>No one allowed to wait for signs or loaf
in sign shop.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>RULE IV.</h3>

<p class='c010'>All work must be done in the order in
which it is received. This rule does not
apply to window tickets.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<h3 class='c009'>PEN WRITING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The up-to-date card writer has adopted
the pen to do a great deal of his work, and,
indeed, it is often used to excellent advantage.
A card written with the pen is decidedly
neat and novel, and is very effective.
Perhaps it is not so bold in appearance
as a card written with a brush, but for
a change (and to be up-to-date) it may
serve you to give the pen a trial.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_065c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It requires but little practice to obtain
the mastery of this style of show card writing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Buy a bottle of Sanford’s gloss black
ink, and a few of Soennecke’s round-writing
pens, which may be procured from any
stationer, and see what you can accomplish.
You will find it easy and pleasant
work, and soon be able to do very effective
lettering. Learn to make the simple strokes
first, and then follow the style of lettering
shown you in the illustrations, as this letter
lends itself easily and gracefully to pen
formation. Embellishments may be added
to the letters to suit the fancy of the artist.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c009'>THE USE OF STENCILS IN WINDOW TRIMMING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>As accessories to window trimming,
stencils have come to perform a useful part
in that art of decoration. Where a number
of show cards are to be lettered in the
same manner, no more effective or expeditious
way of getting them out is to be
found than by stenciling the same, unless
it is to have the cards printed, a much more
expensive process. Furthermore, aside
from the mere lettering on the card, the
trimmer may add and reproduce any ornament
or device he choose, and there again
avoid the expense of having a cut engraved.
The experienced window trimmer finds
many uses for his stenciling, and this process
is especially valuable in decorating the
background of a trim, where plain white
papers, colored cartridge papers, cheap
white cloth, burlaps and numerous other
materials may be patterned or lettered at
very little expense and in such a manner
as to add to the attractiveness of the trim.</p>

<p class='c007'>To begin with, the window trimmer needs
but few things for cutting and applying
his stencils: a very sharp knife, any kind
of extra thick paper (this must be coated
with shellac varnish or oiled to prevent the
paint from soaking into it), some paint
brushes, oil and water color paints of the
desired colors, and a bottle of turpentine.
After the pattern or lettering chosen or designed
is traced or drawn upon the paper,
care being taken that the design introduces
cross strips to hold all together, it is cut
away. Then the varnish is applied. When
dry it is taken up and the edges of the stencil
carefully cut here and there where the
varnish may have run over, as it is necessary
to keep them clear and sharp. Next
the desired colors are gotten out; a large
plate will serve for a palette, though separate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>saucers for each color are preferable.
The colors, if oil, are mixed with a great
deal of turpentine, but water colors should
be applied “stiff.” Next the stencil is held
firmly against the fabric to be lettered or
decorated, and quickly but neatly painted
over, care being taken that the stencil pattern
does not slip and rub the design, and
that part of the fabric appearing through
the stencil each time is thus stamped. The
design can be repeated on the fabric at will
and in any arrangement the window trimmer
sees fit. On cards and thin papers it
is better to use thickly mixed water colors
in place of oil colors, as these latter are
liable to spread. In the cities one can get
stencils already cut, but there is no reason
why the window trimmer should not design
and cut his own, as very little practice
in this art makes perfect, and one’s own designs
are, for many purposes, generally
more applicable. Stencil, alphabets of various
sizes can be bought, costing all the
way from fifty cents to $1.50 a set, according
to their size. These the window trimmer
will find very valuable aids in lettering
his show and price cards.</p>

<p>THE STENCIL PLATE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An exceedingly pretty effect was noticed
in a down town New York shoe dealer’s
window, gotten by giving the trim for
a background a screen of light olive burlaps,
upon which the monogram of the firm
was placed in stenciled pattern in metallic
colors. A little ingenuity along this line
cannot fail to produce equally valuable effects.
If the spaces left by a stenciled letter
are objected to, these spaces may be
easily filled in with a brush, as is shown in
the letter “R” in the illustration. By the
use of stencils many pretty backgrounds
may be made. Paper the sides and back of
your window with common white print paper,
and then stencil a pretty border around
them, with ornaments to suit your fancy.
Stenciled ornaments may also be used to
decorate your card work. If you have a
neat monogram of the firm’s initials cut,
you can use it in the corner of all your show
cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have a big window to decorate
with fancy handkerchief folds it will be a
good plan to get two or three salesgirls to
assist in the folding. Show them how to
fold the designs you require and their work
will save you much valuable time. The pinning

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>The diagram will give you a better idea
of the folds than the other pictures, which
are reproductions of direct photographs
from the goods themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>To produce the figure of “The Greek
Cross,” proceed as follows: After the handkerchief
is spread out full size turn down
all four corners exactly to the center, producing
No. 1. Then turn face downward
and again fold the corners to the center,
along the dotted lines A, B, C, D. This
makes No. 2, which is also turned face down
and the corners turned to the center along
the lines A, B, C, D, and secured with bent
pins. The pattern is now turned with the
face upwards and the final figure is easily
completed, as shown in No. 3. Four loose
laps appear, and by placing the forefinger
of each hand within these laps at point AA,
and lifting the same the flaps straighten out
and form B (No. 3). When all the flaps
are raised and straightened the cross is
formed and the figure completed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Having formed this figure you may proceed
to the more intricate folds derived
from this foundation. While making these
first folds a couple of sheets of stiff paper
will be of assistance in keeping them in
place while turning them over. Another
thing is to have the handkerchiefs ironed
smooth, and if they are stiff from starch all
the better.</p>

turn it over, then turn corners E, F, G, H,
to center. Allow it to remain with same
face upward. Turn new corner to the center
and secure it. Now turn the handkerchief
face upward and center points will
turn themselves outward. The inner points
are turned back from the center, making
the complete figure as shown.</p>

the use of two handkerchiefs folded one

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='c008'>ILLUSION WINDOWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_078.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One of the best modes of attraction for
window displays is the “illusion” centerpiece.
It originated with dime museums
and side shows, but is none the less sure
to arouse the curiosity of the observer. The
illusion consists of a beautiful young lady,
the lower half of whose body is invisible to
the spectator, the upper portion so resting
on a pedestal as to appear to have an
independent existence. The effect of the
illusion is very striking. It is produced in
a very simple manner: A pedestal of wood
is arranged as shown in the accompanying
sketch, the upper portion being a hollow
bowl resting on a solid pillar or post, a
sufficient portion of the bowl being cut away
to allow room for the young lady who is to
take part in the illusion to stand immediately
behind the pillar and within the upper
portion of the pedestal. Extending at right
angles from the pillar at either side are mirrors
imbedded in the pedestal and having
the edges A B and G H concealed by sprays
of artificial flowers or other ornament extending
from top of pedestal to platform
on which it rests. Similar sprays are placed
at front. The lower portion of the mirror
is concealed by the drapery which constitutes
a part of the window display or of the
background. The drapery at either side of
the window corresponds to that of the background.
Its reflection in the mirrors deceives
the spectator into the belief that he
sees the drapery of the background beneath
and around the pedestal.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>This attraction could be used to advantage
for the display of millinery, fans, parasols,
etc. The best effect is obtained by
having the figure quite a distance above the
spectator.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE VANISHING LADY.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_079a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“THE VANISHING LADY.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_079b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>An amplification of the foregoing illusion
is called “The Vanishing Lady,” and we
reproduce a picture of a window in which
this effect was a recent attraction. It occupied
but a small space in the center of the
display, showing the bust and head of a
pretty young woman, supported on a thin
pedestal with a large bowl top. From the
waist down the young woman was invisible;
at the same time one could see all around
the pedestal, which produced a startling
illusion. At short intervals this young
woman would disappear right into the pedestal
(or so it would seem), and presently
would reappear with new hat, waist, gloves,
etc. This would continue, showing every
ten minutes or so a complete change of hat,
etc. The following diagram with description
will explain the workings. A platform
2 feet 6 inches high is built in the window,
with three frames around, 7 feet high,
draped in green plush. Erect a thin pedestal,
with two large wooden meat chopping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>bowls, one on top, one on bottom, neatly
enameled. One-quarter of the bowls at
back are cut away, two grooves cut in pedestal
and two mirrors set in, as in diagram.
The mirrors reflect the sides of frame, which
gives the appearance of seeing all around.
A trap door in the floor allows the girl to
disappear down a simply constructed elevator
into the basement, where she changes
her hat, neckwear, etc., to again reappear.
The elevator is balanced by two bags of
sand. When the girl gets off, a bolt is put
in the beam to keep the platform from flying
up. This window was a great success.
The second day the firm using it was compelled
to put up an iron rail in front of plate
glass for fear it would be broken by the
crowds. The young woman was very pretty,
and every hat was becoming; and her
changes were many during the day.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A CLEVER ILLUSION.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Fig. 1 shows an original method for a
novel window attraction. It consists in
having a plush covered box on a table in
the center of the show window, and arranged
in the rear as shown in Fig. 2.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_080a.jpg' alt='1 2' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The box should be about the right size
to accommodate the head and shoulders of
a person. A hole is cut in the cover,
through which the person’s head projects.
The entire bottom of the box is removed
and a corresponding opening is cut in the
top of the table. By looking at the arrangement
from the front, the head, flags,
box and table are seen, and every one wonders
where is the rest of the person. The
box is of course much too small to hold a
person, and as the space beneath the table
appears perfectly clear, the mystery is increased.
This illusion is easily performed.
Fig. 2 shows a side and rear view.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole plan is effected by means of
two pieces of plate mirror, A and B. These
pieces should be high enough to reach from
the floor to the lower side of the table top,
and wide enough to extend at an angle with
each, of about 45 degrees, the angle forming
C, where the sides join, and ending far
enough back to cover the person. The
angular formation of the mirrors will reflect
the floor in front, and if the edges of the
mirror are draped so as not to show from
the front, the appearance from the street is
that the space below the table top is open,
and that the person of the individual whose
head projects from the box is in some mysterious
way confined in the very limited
room which the box affords. The plate mirror
is the only costly article, and as this is
not injured by use for a few weeks, it can
be resold, or perhaps rented in the beginning.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE HIGH COLLAR ILLUSION.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_080b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The effect shown in figure 1 never fails to
attract a great deal of notice. It is easily
performed by two persons as illustrated in
figure 1. The former is a front view, and
from the street the people see a person sitting
comfortably in a chair in the center of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the show window. The remarkable feature
is the very long neck of the person, on
which is a collar two or three feet high.
The trick is done with mirrors as in figure
2. First, quite a tall man is required to
stand upright like the figure at the back.
The upper part of the high collar circles
this man’s neck. The collar is cut open at
the back so that the shoulders are on the
outside. The collar extends down and over
the head of the second man. The latter
is of small size, generally a boy. He is
placed on chair G, facing to the front.
Plate mirrors C and D are now set up at an
angle with each other of about 65 degrees.
The edges of the mirrors join at F, completely
obscuring the body of the man at
the rear from the front view. It is necessary
that the mirrors be cut out at E for the
shoulders and correctly matched at B, so
that from the front or the street, only the
man’s head and the collar show. If rightly
adjusted, persons looking in from the front
will see only the man in the chair, the high
collar and the head. Of course the effect
is startling and novel, but it always interests.
The edges of the mirrors should be
trimmed with any goods which it is desired
to advertise. The reflection in the mirrors
make it appear as if the space back of the
chair were vacant.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TO SHOW THREE DISPLAYS AT ONCE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Fig. 1 is a section through the basement,
ground floor and second floor of a store in
which an arrangement of reflecting mirrors
makes it possible for a person who is looking
into the show window from G to see
what is displayed on the floors above and
below. First the window floor is cut out at
A and the top at B. Mirrors, C and D, are
adjusted on the back of the openings, inclined
twenty to thirty degrees. Each mirror
is the width of the opening, which would
be about two-thirds the width of the window.
The mirrors must be pivoted on adjustable
frames so as to permit a proper setting
for a good effect. The height of each
mirror would be about five and one-half
feet, and swung so that about three feet is
inside the floor and ceiling line of the window.
The large mirrors, E and F, are
arranged as shown. That in the basement
should reach nearly to the ceiling, and
should be wide enough to take in the floor.
The upper mirror is arranged similarly.
The next move consists in so placing the
goods in the ground floor show window
that the edges of the small mirrors are covered,
also the edges of the openings to the
basement and top floor. The spectator
standing on the sidewalk at G sees not only
the goods in the ground show window, but
his sight line is reflected from H to I and
he sees all that is displayed in the basement.
By glancing upward, his sight line is reflected
to J, thence to K, and he sees the
second floor display.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='c008'>MOTORS FOR MECHANICAL DISPLAYS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The best motor for all general purposes
is without doubt an electric motor. These
can be procured at a moderate cost as small
as ¼-horse power, which is sufficient for
an ordinary mechanical effect.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE ELECTRIC MOTOR</h3>

<p class='c010'>May be attached to the regular supply wire,
and is so little trouble to the trimmer that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>it is preferable to all other motors whenever
it can be used. It is frequently necessary</p>

<h3 class='c009'>TO REDUCE SPEED</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of an electric or fan motor, and the simplest
method is to attach incandescent lights
to it. For a fan motor two 32-candle power
incandescents will materially reduce the
speed, as they cut off just the amount of
power required to run them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In towns where there is no electricity one
of the following simple motors will be found
serviceable and easily constructed:</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A WATER MOTOR.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The water motor is made of tin, in the
same form as an ordinary overshot water
wheel, is 30 inches in diameter by 3 inches
wide, with a ½-inch rod through the center.
A 2-inch pulley is fastened to one end
of the rod, for the belt. Any tinner will make
one of these motors and incase it in tin for
$5 or $6.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ANOTHER TYPE OF SMALL WATER MOTORS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>There is usually plenty of water available
in stores, and it does not require much
pressure to get from two to five horse power
from a little motor of so simple design
that almost any one can construct one with
a few tools and at small cost. The accompanying
description is for making a motor
from which to obtain air for a sand blast,
wind power for window devices, etc. The
wheel consists of a cylinder on a shaft, having
nearly semi-circular buckets on its periphery.
The water is directed by the nozzle
nearly tangential to the upper side of
the bucket, and after traversing around the
wall of the bucket it leaves in a nearly horizontal
line in the opposite direction to that
from which it entered. As the water leaves
the bucket it drops slightly below the level
of the wheel and falls into the basin, from
which it passes off through a drain pipe.
The water power is direct from a hose.
The motor will be very useful for operating
mechanical window devices. The wheel is
sixteen inches diameter, and the buckets
are one and one-eighth inches square and
two inches apart, and they are made of galvanized
iron, soldered together, while the
wheel is one off from an old ordinary bicycle.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_082.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A SIMPLE WATER MOTOR FOR RUNNING WINDOW DEVICES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The axle is a piece of old water pipe.
An empty box will do for the case for the
wheel. A wheel of these proportions, run
with about sixty-five pounds pressure per
square inch at the nozzle the latter having
⅞-inch jet, should revolve the wheel at a
speed sufficient to develop two-horse power.
The water pressure is taken in at the
nozzle, and the outlet is at the bottom. If
possible, take the water from the main
pipe coming from the street main and reduced
to one and a half inches, just before
reaching the motor. With a head of water
of forty feet, a power amounting to about
1½ horse power is obtained, using one nozzle.
This is sufficient to run an 8 or 10-inch
fan, a small dynamo or other light machinery
in the store.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE SAND MOTOR.</h3>

<p class='c010'>For slowly moving mechanical displays
the following motor is reliable and satisfactory:</p>

<p class='c007'>A frame of wood (a) is first made, in
which is placed a shaft (c) and a wooden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>pulley (b). The pulley should be tightly secured
to the shaft, the end of the latter
resting in a step (d) secured to the bottom
of the frame. Upon the top of the shaft
place a circular board, which holds your
display. A cord is run once around your
pulley, and then over a small wheel (e) at
either side, from whence both ends drop
through a hole in the window floor. One
end of the cord is weighted, the other connected
with a flat weight resting upon the
sand, which is your motive power. Make
an upright box, as shown in the illustration,
with a partition in the middle. In the
center of the partition make a small hole for
the sand to filter through. The size of the
hole regulates the speed of your motor.
The box should have a cover for each end.
As the sand falls through the hole in the
partition the weight which rests upon the
sand falls also, your pulley wheel being revolved
at the same time. When the sand
has run through, which may be in an hour
or six hours, as you will arrange, cover
the top of the box, reverse it, and place the
weight upon the sand again. It is the same
principle as the hour glass, and is easily
made and operated.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>THE CLOCK MOTOR.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This is not very strong, but is capable of
running simple and evenly balanced mechanical
displays.</p>

<p class='c007'>Procure a common wooden weight clock,
such as is called a “Columbus Clock.” Any
jeweler can purchase it for you at a small
price, if he has not one in stock. Run a
wire through the highest geared wheel,
sharp on one end, to run on a pivot acting
below. Connect your fixture to this pivot
wheel. Pull up the weight, and the mechanism
will run very easily. It needs to
be rewound every three hours. To increase
speed, add to the weight. If your mechanism
is nicely adjusted, it will require no
more power to run it than may be obtained
from one of these clock motors.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='c008'>MECHANICAL DISPLAYS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mechanical window dressing has made
great strides during the past few years, and
has become an important factor in successful
displays. When you hear a decorator
sneer at mechanical features you may be
sure he has himself no mechanical genius
or he would not endeavor to belittle so genuine
an attraction. Not that mechanical
displays are suitable for all occasions, but
there are times in every decorator’s experience
when a “motion window” is really a
necessity, and many other times when mechanism
is a desirable adjunct to a display
that otherwise would be commonplace.
People are naturally curious. They will always
stop to examine anything that moves,
and will enjoy studying out the mechanism
or wondering how the effect has been obtained.
Any decorator is capable of figuring
out for himself diverse attractive mechanical
displays, but for the benefit of
those who may require preliminary instructions,
or need on occasion a device already
planned, I shall describe several effects
that have been used by prominent decorators
during the past few months, as well

boards 10 in. square for the ends and 1-inch
strips for the corners. Cover all four sides
with pasteboard, it being puffed with
cheesecloth. Then make a hexagonal box
the same length, ten inches on a side. Treat
this the same as the others. Now fasten
across the window, eight feet from the floor,
three two-inch strips. Place the first one
18 inches from the glass, making them as
far apart as the window will admit of, the
distance being equal, and the last one being
at least ten inches from the back of the
window. On the underside of the two end
strips fasten a curtain fixture 12 inches from
each end, and one of the same kind in the
center of middle strip; on one end of each
box fasten a curtain fixture to fit those on
the strips. On the other end of each box
fasten a 10-inch wood pulley; the pulley to
be 2 inches from the end of the box and 3
inches from the floor. Make the connection
from the floor to the end of the box
with a 2-inch square post; fit curtain fixtures
in the floor and to the end of the

<h3 class='c009'>REVOLVING STAR.</h3>

<p class='c010'>In the picture is shown a mechanical window
which was very simple, very attractive
and which sold a great many goods. The
center star, which revolved slowly, was ten
feet across, or from tip to pit, and had a
green incandescent light placed in the center,
which flashed three times to each revolution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>The half-stars on the sides each
contained a red incandescent light which
burned continuously. This display, while
very simple, was one of the most attractive
windows I have seen, it being almost impossible
for a person to pass on either side
of the street without it attracting their attention.
The goods shown were French
ginghams arranged in regard to their respective
colors. The power used to move
the star was a small fan motor geared to
gain power at the expense of speed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here is a very pretty idea of a skirt sale,
which the designer has transposed to a
“skirt sail.” The illustration will give you
a fair idea of the window. The background
and floor were of pink colored material, the
boat being covered with white crepe paper
and trimmed with red, white and blue ribbon.
The sail itself was a handsome skirt
of illuminated silk, thrown into stronger
relief by having all the other skirts black.
Water, of course, was represented by light
blue goods, and ladder effects with rope
covered with 3-inch strips of fringed crepe
paper. The boat was given a rocking motion
by means of a simple device which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>illustrate, attached to a ⅛-horse power
electric motor, geared down to a 5-inch
crank. A rope is run through a small pulley
on the floor to another pulley
under the boat, and then attached to
the end of the boat. A roller shade spring
is fastened to the other end, the boat being
hinged in the middle.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MECHANICAL SHIPS.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Another method of imitating a ship riding
the waves is shown herewith. The hull,
A, is a plain piece of board, and the masts
are strips of wood nailed to this. Purchase
a common bed spring and attach it to the
center of the keel, as at B, and attach the
lower part of the spring to a piece of wood
on the window floor. If the balance is right
it will be simply necessary to tip the ship a
little to set it rocking to and fro in imitation
of riding the waves. A little wheel can
be set at C, and a cord put under it and
connected with the hull. The cord can run
to a point inside the store, where it can be
pulled occasionally by hand, thus setting
the ship to rocking. Or this cord can be
connected to a door or to an electric motor.
Next, the ship is trimmed. The hull, railing,
mast, etc., are covered or wound with
white or colored stuff, and the sails are
made of lace or any desired fabric. The surface
of the sea is represented with appropriate
cloth. A slit should be cut, into
which to put the hull, and the edges are
tacked to the wood several inches below
the ship’s rail. The cloth will then follow
the motion of the ship, and closely represent
waves.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A WINDMILL.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_086c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A cheap windmill frame and wheel can
be made as in the accompanying drawing.
The stand is wood, and the two upright
pieces are bored out at the top for the
broom handle shaft A. A hub of wood, B,
is attached to one end, and four blades cut
from thin wood are inserted. A large spool,
C, is put on the other end of the shaft, and
a cord run over this to a wheel, D, below.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The frame, shaft and wheel should be
trimmed with appropriate material, and a
pasteboard front put up in representation
of the old-fashioned grinding mill. The
pasteboard should be painted in imitation of
stone work.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ANOTHER WINDMILL.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Another style of windmill can be made in
this way: Place on the floor in the middle
of the window a box 24 in. square, 4 ft.
high. On top of this box fasten a wheel 5
ft. in diameter. On top of this wheel fasten
an octagonal box 3½ ft. across at the bottom
and 2 ft. at the top, 3 ft. high. On the
top of this box fasten bearings for a shaft
3 ft. long. On the end of this shaft fasten
four arms to measure 24 in. from shaft; also
fasten a large pulley to this shaft in the center
of the box. Over this pulley the belt is
run to the motor below. Over the top of
the box construct a roof; then at the back
of the box that rests on the floor build a
frame as wide as the box and 3 ft. high, this
to extend to back of the window. Over this
make a roof so that the apex is just a little
above the large wheel. Cover all the wood
with cloth, then with any kind of goods you
may desire. Start your motor and you will
have an old-fashioned windmill in operation.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_087b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>I show herewith drawings for the construction
of a wheel upon which skirts may
be displayed. The face of the wheel concaves,
or slopes in toward the center. White
skirts, under which colored paper has been
placed, may be fastened around the outside,
either in the form of a circle or a hexagon,
the bottoms of the skirts being at the side
of the wheel. Then, almost at the center,
arrange four more skirts the same as
the others. Then cover the tops of the last
skirts with a large, round ticket, fastened
to the wheel with a hat pin, and weighted,
so that the ticket will remain stationary
while the wheel revolves. The wheel may
be of any size, to suit your window, and
should be constructed of pine or other light
material. It is extremely simple, and may
be constructed by any one, while, as may
be seen at a glance, it is sure to be a very
attractive display.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE FOLDING STAR.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The design is a background, to be used
in connection with any line of goods. When
the star is closed all that fronts the spectator
is a mass of white puffing. It slowly
opens and reveals a recess in which is a display
of goods strongly lighted by hidden
incandescents. The effect is beautiful and
is sure to attract attention. The back of
the points, which form the star when it is
opened, are puffed in yellow or some other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>color harmonizing with your display. Upon
each point, the framework of which is
shown here, is fastened a spring hinge, such
as is used on screen doors. These hinges
operate to close the points. Strong picture
wire is used to draw back the points, and
this must be fastened as near the hinges
as possible in order that it may be concealed
by the puffing, as it is on the face of
the display, pulling the points out. By
covering the hinges and wire with stiff paper,
and puffing over that, a space will be
left for the wire to run in and render it invisible.
The pulleys at the three corners
of the framework, as shown in the drawing,
should be double, the wires running over
them being spliced a few inches beyond the
pulleys. The large drive wheel shown in
the basement should be set up with one
standard to allow the wires to make a complete
revolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have mirrors, and can set them on
each side of the star at an angle of about
45 degrees, they will by reflection give your
display the effect of three stars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where this idea is used for a millinery
window the face of the display could be covered
by white flowers instead of puffing,
and the points of the stars with bunches of
violets.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE MECHANICAL STAR.</h3>

<p class='c010'>First build a large star, six, eight or ten
points, according to number of articles to
be displayed, which can be twice as many
as the number of points on large star. To
the center of this star fasten a round shaft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>or axle, allowing it to extend on back of
star only, and be flush with front of star
(see B, fig. 2). On this shaft, and about 3
inches from the star fasten a wheel with a
groove in edge to receive a round belt (A,
fig. 2). Then build upright (C, figs. 2 and
3).<a id='t93'></a> On top of this upright fasten two bearings
(D, figs. 2 and 3). Through these
bearings pass the shaft (B) and fasten in
place with pins (E, E, fig. 2), these to prevent
shaft pan coming out when in motion.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_089a.jpg' alt='FIG. 6. FIG. 2.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Next make twice as many small 5-pointed
stars as points on large star. On back, and
exactly in center of these, glue some small
pieces of heavy cardboard, about the size of
a penny, and in center of back of same star,
at bottom, fasten some lead or other
weights. See fig. 1.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_089b.jpg' alt='FIG. 1.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Next decorate face of large star by pleating
the points in cheesecloth, or any other
way desired, and after having lettered the
face of each of the small stars pass a large
pin through the re-enforcement in center of
them and fasten one to each of the points
of the large star, as shown in fig. 1. The
large star, shown in center of fig. 1 should
be treated the same as the small ones. If
you take hold of the grooved wheel or shaft
and turn it now, it should cause the large
star to revolve carrying the small ones with
it; but the small weights on back of small
stars will cause them to remain right side
up, as will also the star in center, and if not
run too fast will produce a very pretty
effect.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The dotted line shown in fig. 2 shows the
background of window, which should pass
immediately in back of large star, and front
of grooved wheel, thereby concealing all
other mechanism.</p>

<p class='c007'>This design may be varied by removing
the small stars and in their place substituting
small swinging shelves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should these shelves be used instead of
stars, almost any kind of articles (not too
heavy or large) can be displayed, as could
also slippers or shoes hung in the same
manner. In fact, this contrivance can be
used in many ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that the effect is all ready it becomes
necessary to cause it to revolve and
it is imperative to in some way reduce the
speed of the motor.</p>

<p class='c007'>A practical speed reducer is shown in fig.
4. It is made as follows:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_090a.jpg' alt='FIG. 4.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Two cast iron side frames, between which
I run a worm gear. Against this gear is
run a worm. On the end of the worm shaft
I have a pulley with two different sized
grooves in the edge. To this pulley I run
my motor belt, on the shaft which runs
through the worm gear and is allowed to
extend outside of frames. I fasten another
pulley wheel with different size grooves in
edge and by running my power belt from
this wheel to my display I get whatever
speed I desire, depending on which groove
I run the belt from. I do not expect many
window dressers will be able to construct
these gears themselves, but any good machinist
can make it and once secured it will
always be ready for use, take up very little
room in window and pay for itself many
times over.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_090b.jpg' alt='FIG. 4.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Figs. 2 to 4 illustrate how to make a
revolving wheel for showing goods. The
stand is made of four pieces of 1 × 1½ pine,
A, three feet high, and the top joined with
cross pieces, B, of the same stock. Bore an
inch hole for the wheel shaft on each side.
The wheel is three and a half feet in diameter.
Hooping will do for the rims, C, and
these are nailed to wood spokes and the
latter wired to a hub made from a block of
wood, and bored out for the inch shaft on
which the wheel is to turn. The wheel is
strengthened by nailing on a second hoop
at D. The whole affair should be covered
with cloth, and swinging boxes attached
to the rims, in which to put goods. The
view 3 shows the width of the wheel and a
wood grooved pulley fastened to the wheel
shaft at F. Fig. 4 shows how to make the
wheel turn about four times per minute.
After the wheel and frame are set up in the
window, make a stand of wood pieces, C C,
and put a 2-inch diameter round piece of
wood, H, in holes cut for same and arrange
for turning by means of the crank, J. Put
up a grooved wood pulley at L, and run a
cord over this. One end of the cord is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>weighted with a few bricks, M. The pulley,
K, is the same as pulley, F, in fig. 3. Another
cord encircles this and also the round
piece, H. The crank, J, is turned, and thirty
or forty turns of the cord taken on the
round piece H. Then the device is left
alone, and the weight of the bricks steadily
pulls on the cord, gradually unwinding it,
causing the round piece, H, to turn and
slowly revolve the big wheel. After an
hour or so the cord is unwound and is rewound
by turning the crank again.</p>

of a like character, two bust forms
may be made to turn half way around, in
opposite directions, then pause, and turn
back to their original positions. This is
accomplished by means of a large wheel to
which two eccentrics are attached, each eccentric
being connected with a standard
holding a bust. Our diagram shows the
floor plan of the mechanism, the large 18-inch
wheel, which is run by means of an

<p class='c007'>Make a box 4½ ft. high and 18 in. wide;
open two sides 15 in. from the top; set this
box on end, the open side to the top. The
open side also to face the glass and to be

window. Make a little platform 12 × 18,
about 6 in. below the opening in front; a
like platform, only to be longer and even
with the opening in the back. Now bore
a hole in each side of the box about the
center of the opening and insert a shaft.
On this shaft inside the box nail four light
boards, 6 in. wide and 15 in. long; then
fasten a 4-in. pulley to the end of the shaft
and connect with the motor. Now fill the

letting it slope down toward the glass.
Cover the entire floor with straw, and also
the platform in the back. Then place hats
on stands on the floor and suspend hats

<p class='c007'>“In describing the window as seen
through the plate glass, one can easily imagine
he is looking at a bit of nature, only
in a miniature form. In the foreground,
moored to a dock, is seen a gondola, majestically
rising and falling upon an effect that
looks precisely like a deep, clear body of
water, with a slow, even motion so perfect
that it is impossible to determine when it
begins or stops. In the distance old Vesuvius
is belching fire and lava, which looks
so real it is hard to believe it is only an
illusion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rising and falling motion to the water
effect was made on the plan of scale beams,
as can be seen in drawing. Cords were
fastened to ends of levers marked ‘B’ and
passing them under rollers ‘E’ and hooking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the other ends to crank-wheel ‘C.’ As
wheel ‘C’ would revolve it pulled levers
down, causing center, containing water effect,
on which was placed the gondola, to
rise, and in turn the weight of the gondola
would cause the center to fall when levers
were released by wheel. I used window
weights to balance it, allowing center to be
heavy enough to sink of its own weight.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The water effect was obtained by placing
a piece of double strength window glass,
3 ft. × 3 ft. 6 in. on the frame, the detail
of which you will find illustrated. Underneath
it I placed a canvas frame painted
near the same shade as the water in the
foreground of my canvas representing Vesuvius.
On the top of said frame I puffed
loosely very fine veiling. I also puffed the
veiling on top glass. The painted canvas
frame gave me the water color, the glass,
the realistic reflection, and the veiling mystified
the whole. Hence a perfect water illusion,
well worth trying. The fire and lava
belching from the crater of mountain I obtained
in the following manner: I first covered
the entire canvas on back with heavy
paper, making it perfectly opaque, then I
tore a hole, beginning at the top or crater
of mountain, about 5 inches wide, widening
gradually as I went upwards, and to one
side. Then I cut several openings large
enough to admit little streaks of light on
the left slope of mountain to represent lava
running down the side, above which I cut
a round hole for the moon; all which can
be plainly seen in the picture. Back of
opening representing lava I pasted different
shades of red paper (tissue paper) and back
of moon yellow. Back of the large opening
at the top of mountain I placed a large
wheel made of two layers of red tissue paper
with little tufts of grey wadding between.
Back of this wheel, exactly opposite
the opening representing the crater, I
placed a lamp. When set in motion I had
the most beautiful representation of real,
burning fire. As the different thicknesses
of the wheel would pass the lamp they were
illuminated, and as they passed on up they
would cool off and finally die, disappearing
in the smoke and steam, which was represented
by carefully tufted white and grey
cotton on the front of canvas. Two lamps
higher up illuminated the smoke and steam
in the sky; another to light up streaks of
lava seen on the left slope; and the fifth
lamp for the moon, which threw its yellow
glow in beautiful contrast to the ever raging,
burning flames from the crater of Vesuvius.
In conclusion, I wish to say that
I know my attempt at describing these effects
is a failure, compared to seeing them
in reality.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A STUDY IN ASTRONOMY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>One of the most remarkable mechanical
displays yet conceived is that designed by

It is not theoretical, but has

and has attracted and delighted thousands.
It is, to be sure, rather complicated in construction,
and requires a mechanic to build
it, so that it will work smoothly; but it is
thoroughly practical, and so very novel and
beautiful when completed that it will repay
the labor expended to produce it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The device is intended as a background
for any display of goods, and may be utilized
by any merchant who has a show window,
the expense being very little aside
from labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his description Mr. Mohnkern says:
“In looking at this display through the
show window one can easily imagine he
has been transferred to some other planet
and is looking at the solar system, where
old mother earth revolves slowly around
the sun. In the distance the moon is changing,
first in the dark of the moon to the
first quarter, then to the half, the third quarter
and the full moon, decreasing again in
the same way. The stars twinkle as naturally
as they do in the heavens; the whole
display is grand and awe inspiring.” We
can well believe this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 1 is the front view of the window,
showing the sun, moon, earth and stars,
and the orbit of the earth where it revolves
around the sun. A strip of lumber was
bent into a large circle, almost the full size
of the window. Black cambric was stretched
from this to the four sides of the window,
and openings cut in the corners for the
stars and moon, as represented, C C C being
the stars, and D the moon. Back of each of
the three stars in each corner small wheels
were placed (see F F F, Fig. 2). These
wheels were twice as large as the stars, and
placed so that the center of each wheel was
directly opposite a point of a star. Then
half of each wheel was covered with black
cambric and the other half with bright red.
As the wheels revolved very fast, it made
them twinkle like real stars. The moon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>was a large round hole cut in the cambric
with yellow tissue paper pasted back of it,
and an electric light suspended behind the
opening. A disk is made, a little larger than
the opening, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. A,
Fig. 5, is the opening of the cambric; B is
the disk; C is where the disk is connected
with the axle. This disk is covered with
black cambric and placed between the cambric
background and the window pane.
Thus it will be seen that as the disk slowly
swung around, the changes of the moon
would occur.</p>

<img src='images/i_097.jpg' alt='A STUDY IN ASTRONOMY FIG. 1. FIG. 2. FIG. 3. FIG. 4. FIG. 5. FIG. 6.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Two more strips of lumber were now
bent into circles, about eighteen to twenty
inches smaller in diameter than the first circle.
One of these was placed flush with the
first circle and held in position by means
of braces I I. This circle was then covered
by stretching black cambric snugly over it,
and an opening was cut in the center to
represent the sun (B, Fig. 1). Yellow tissue
paper was pasted over this, and an electric
light suspended directly back of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Star-shaped openings were now cut in
this cambric, as shown by the stars in the
central portion of Fig. 1.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second circle was placed about six
inches back of this (see Fig. 3, A 1 and A
2). It was held in position by braces F F,
Fig. 3. These two circles formed a track
on which the earth slowly revolved. Another
circle was next formed, similar to the
first one, except that this had four spokes,
I I I and J, Fig. 2. The spoke marked J
was long enough to reach the center of the
globe and connect to an axle, as seen in
Fig. 3. This circle was also covered with
black cambric, and irregular holes cut in
it (H H H, Fig. 2), over which pieces of red
tissue paper were pasted. These are represented
by the irregular patches in Fig. 2.
This rear disk was fastened to a pivot (Fig.
3) and placed three inches back of the front
disk in which the stars and sun were cut.
As it slowly revolved it carried the globe
around with it, and the irregular tissue paper
opening coming opposite each star
caused the stars to twinkle like those in the
corners.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earth was constructed as follows:
Two bushel baskets were procured, the
handles cut off, and a brace nailed across
the center of each. Holes were bored in
the middle of these braces, and an axle inserted
(B, Fig. 4) and made fast to the bottom
of the basket. Then the spoke J, Fig.
4, which has a hole in the end, is slipped
over the axle and the other basket placed
in position and fastened opposite the first.
The baskets were left far enough apart to
allow them to revolve. In Fig. 4, A A, are
the baskets, B is the axle, c c c c braces, J
the spoke, corresponding with J in Figs. 2
and 3.</p>

<p class='c007'>The profile drawing in Fig. 3 will enable
you to see the mechanism at a glance. A1
and A2 are the circles on which the globe
representing the earth revolves; B is the
disk with the long spoke, J, placed between
these two circles; C is the pivot which
causes disk B to revolve. D D are the
braces holding disk B in position. F F and
I I are the braces holding A1 and A2 in
position; G is the pulley on pivot C that
run the different parts; K is the main belt
leading from the basement; L L L are belts
running to pivots H H H. All framework
liable to show should be made black; also
have the cords you use for belts black.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>REVOLVING CYLINDER.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This is a simple but very effective mechanical
contrivance, and may be constructed
by any amateur:</p>

<p class='c007'>Make three circular pieces from one-inch
planed boards, A A A. Through the exact
centers of these run a rod, EE. Nail two-inch
strips, c c c, placed a little distance
apart, over the discs, one of which is placed
at either end, and the third in the center.
This forms the barrel, AAA, with the rod,
EE, as pivot. This pivot rests on crotches,
DD, allowing the barrel to revolve when
the motive power below (at G) causes the
fly-wheel, which is securely fastened to E,
to turn by means of the circular band, B.
The crotches, DD, should be high enough
to bring the barrel to the center and middle
of the window.</p>

<p>THE READING CYLINDER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Cover the barrel with cloth—a dark material
is best—and upon this pin or tack the
articles to be displayed. Almost any articles,
not too large, may be shown, and they
should be so arranged as to present variety
as the wheel revolves. Suspend a screen
in your window that will cover the mechanical
apparatus, only allowing the front section
of the barrel to show. Thus, as the
barrel slowly revolves, a panorama of merchandise
is shown the observer, and the
constant change will undoubtedly attract
much attention. You may letter the screen
in any manner that suits your fancy, and
this arrangement will not prevent your
placing other goods in the window before
your screen, as the revolving barrel will be
high enough not to interfere with anything
shown on the window floor.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>WIND POWER.</h3>

<p class='c010'>One good use to which the wind force
obtained from a fan motor can be put is
shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1 is a section
of a water tank, which tank should
sit in the show window, filled with water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_100a.jpg' alt='1 2' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A toy ship is on the water and is guided
in a track, A, which track is attached to
bottom of tank. Guide wires, B, B, extend
from the ship to grooves in the track. Fans,
C, C, are set up at each end and are covered
with window trimmings in front so
that they are not in view. The fans are run
by means of cords from the motor. The
arrangement of the fans is as shown in the
top view of the tank in Fig. 2. The fan at
the left is at D, and the wind it produces
sends the ship across the tank at opposite
side, on line with the arrow. The grooved
track holds the guide wires B, B, of the
ship, and steers the ship around G, and the
momentum carries the ship to H, where
the blast of air from the fan at E sends the
ship along course I to J, and thence opposite
D again, where the course is commenced
over again.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PERPETUAL MOTION.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A perpetual motion wheel never fails to
attract attention in a show window. There
is one form of perpetual wheel device which
can be made very easily, as it consists of a
simple mechanism such as is shown here.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_100c.jpg' alt='6' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wheel is three feet in diameter, of
light wood and crude construction, provided
with eight arms disposed radially so as
to be separated by angles of 45<a id='t104'></a> degrees, as
shown. The axle is supported in bearings
of wood. Each arm is provided with a
movable weight of five pounds, being movable
on a pivot or hinge on the arms so as
to transfer the weight from the axis to the
periphery, whereby, as it appears to the eye,
the wheel is continually overweighted on
one side, and revolves slowly. Attached to
the base, A, is an upright piece of wood, B,
and a spring hooked wire, G, extends from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the top of this to the point D. Here the
hook part tips up the weights as they come
around in turn, causing each to drop over
on its arm, thus placing the weight further
from the center, and making the wheel turn.
The center of gravity of the wheel varies
from a point on the left of the center to a
point at an equal distance on the right, according
to the location of the arms at the
particular point in the rotation of the wheel.
The wheel can be draped with light goods
and made attractive. The notice “Perpetual
Motion” should be attached on a card.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MECHANICAL HANDKERCHIEF DISPLAY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>We show a picture of a mechanical handkerchief
display in which the central figure
is a girl in a canoe, who works the paddle
by a simple device.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_101a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A stiff wire attached to one side of center
of paddle, passing through bottom of
canoe, fixed on a wooden wheel under the
fixture. A rubber band is fixed on one side
of paddle to canoe. As the wheel revolves
it sets the paddle in motion. It is worked
by a small motor. The entire display is
made outside in sections and is rapidly
fixed together in the window. The canoe
is of heavy paper.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MECHANICAL PANELS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>To make a double mechanical panel, that
will open and close alternately, follow the
device shown in the below diagram.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cover the faces of the panels, or “doors”
with cloth or puffing, and arrange them so
as to cover two alcoves on opposite sides
of the window. One cord is wound around
the barrel and the other is unwound. When
the barrel is turned, either by hand or by a
motor, one door is raised while the other
drops of its own weight, the doors being
balanced by each other. The motion is
reversed by reversing the barrel, or cylinder.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>“A SCENE IN VENICE.”</h3>

<p class='c010'>The mechanical device called “A Scene in
Venice” consists of a reproduction of the
Trocadero palace, before which constantly
passes a procession of floats or gondolas.
The following diagram shows a ground plan
of the framework of this window.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_101c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A procession of floats bearing dolls
dressed as gondoliers, etc., passes constantly
around the palace. The interior of
the building was lit by colored electric
lights. Six thousand handkerchiefs were
used in this display, but the palace may be
trimmed with linens or other goods.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>This display was arranged with a high
grille at top, supported by columns resting
upon a pedestal or base. Upon this an
enormous fan opened and closed every fifty
seconds. When opened out, only the fan
was visible; when folded, the fan seemed
suspended at one side, revealing a 5-foot
circle, studded with lights and covered with
roses, in the center of which was a bust figure.
On each side of the circle was a 2-foot
wreath tied with white satin ribbon. The
color scheme was white, top blue and ivory,
with narrow moldings. Grille, fan and cornice
at base were covered with dark blue
velvelette. The photograph shows fan
partly open and also decorations behind fan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ribs were fastened together with
straps under the base, and also on the back
of the fan, above base. Ribs were of light
framework, and extended below base, as in
the drawing. Front or first rib extended
down three feet and had a slot through
which a screw was fastened to drive wheel,
which propelled it backward and forward,
or, rather, from side to side; an evenly balanced
weight assisted motor to open fan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sketch will explain mechanical apparatus.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_104.jpg' alt='Fig. 1' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 1 shows fan, spread open, looking
from back of window. A is drive wheel on
a pivot, smooth side facing slot of first or
front rib, and to which screw in slot is attached.
B is an upright supporting rack
(C) through which lower ends of all but
first and last rib work to avoid wobbling.
Dotted lines D are heavy rubber bands
fastened to ends of second and third rib,
and to end of rack, as indicated. D D are
similar bands fastened to end of fourth,
fifth and sixth ribs, and to floor, as in the
drawing. These bands prevent sudden
jerking in opening and closing. E is
small weight on cord, run over pulley to
basement, to assist in spreading fan. This
relieves the strain on drive wheel when
screw in slot is at the top. EE are straps
that hold fan together, and must be proper
length to allow each rib to overlap the next,
in order that decorations behind fan are
concealed when fan is open.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frame of fan was covered with cambric
ovals, shown in photo, which were decorated
in water colors, and body was of velvelette.
Rack was made of thin wood strips
the proper distance apart to hold ribs in
proper position. Lower portions of ribs
were thicker than the upper, to prevent top
from catching when closing. Iron washers
were put on axle between each two ribs
to reduce friction; drive wheel or one at
back, was stationary, the others revolved in
direction of arrow, last rib moving to and
fro.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The window was put in to show a line of
black ostrich tips, and the butterfly was
mechanical, opening and closing its wings
in a natural manner. The background is
figured cotton crepe, put on plain. The
groundwork is crepe, a rich cream base
with figures of heliotrope and green. In
the center is placed the butterfly. It has
eyes of bright green and a body of black
and green. The long feelers were made of
large black plumes, the ends being tipped
with white plumes. The wings were made
of black tips, the marking in the upper
wings being of yellow, while in the lower
wings are two marks, one of white and one
of red. To the right is a pillar with black
velvet base and a green column, and to the
left a pillar with black velvet base and blue
column, both pillars supporting palms. The
festoon drapery is of black velvet. In
front of the butterfly is a square pedestal,
covered with red with a line of black velvet
“lovers knots” down the center of each side.
Palms and trimmed hats make up the floor
decorations. We show a drawing of the
mechanism used to open and close the butterfly’s
wings. As the butterfly was tipped
forward at the top the wings closed of their
own weight. The motor is connected with
a reduction gear and then with a pulley
with a cam, instead of connecting direct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The butterfly itself is 9 feet wide at the
extremes and 6 feet high and is raised about
two feet from the floor.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_107a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wings of the butterfly are but the
thickness of heavy pasteboard at the edge
and ¾ inch towards where the wings join
the body. The two one-inch rods which
open the wings run through the floor to
basement and are covered with same goods
as background and are barely visible. On
the ends of these two rods (see cut) are
two levers at right angles with rod and are
placed in opposition to each other. On
the end of each lever is attached a cord
running to a common point about 3 feet
back of levers. They then go through two
pulleys and combine in a single cord which
is attached to a cam placed 7 inches from
center of pulley. The levers being shorter
than the width of a single wing, this gives
the outer edge of wing a stroke of about
three feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The star closed every twenty-five seconds—the

bright pictures, portraits of prominent men,
etc. The frame is made of ordinary
boards and puffed in two colors. In
the picture shown there was an electric light
in each corner of the frame. Within the
frame the panorama moved constantly from
top to bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The panorama consists of pictures fastened
together endwise upon a belt of ticking
and forming an endless band about two
7-inch rollers, which are placed at the top

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='c008'>ELECTRICITY IN THE WINDOW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Electric power, as applied to the show
window, may be divided into two sections:
(a) Electric lighting, and (b) electric mechanism.
We will consider these sections
separately.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LIGHTING THE WINDOW.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The most approved method of stationary
electric lights for windows are those
placed at the top, next to the window pane,
and so arranged as to throw their light
downward and backward from the observer.
Thus the entire window space is fully illuminated
and the incandescents are themselves
hidden from view. Separate reflectors or
a long reflecting trough of tin should be
placed back of the lights. Special lighting
effects are explained in detail further on,
but the regular lighting is best arranged as
above.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>COLORING ELECTRIC LAMPS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Where colored effects are desired the incandescent
lamp globes may be tinted to
throw distinct or combined colorings over
the entire display.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several preparations that answer
the purpose, and indeed are best at
times. Pikron for glass is excellent, or a
lacquer will answer. However, they sometimes
become spotted from the heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another and better method is by using
white shellac, thinned down with wood alcohol,
and by dipping the globe this produces
a splendid imitation of ground glass
when a white light is needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you wish to use purple, green, blue,
etc., or any of the more delicate tints, such
as violet, buy five cents’ worth of aniline
dye of the color you wish; dissolve it in
wood alcohol and pour it into the shellac,
taking care the shellac is quite thin, as otherwise
it will not cover evenly.</p>

<p>DESIGN SHOWING PANORAMIC EFFECTS.—<i>Sawyer.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>By using these or any other transparent
coloring a vast number of beautiful tints
can be made that will blend perfectly with
your color scheme. Another excellent coloring
is egg dye, treated in the same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I will explain how to go about it.
After preparing your shellac pour it into a
vessel deep enough to immerse your lamp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take a piece of wire, and fasten it around
the socket end of lamp; then bring one end
of the wire back over the end, and fasten to
opposite side to form a loop to hang it up
to drip and dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>This done, dip lamp in the coloring and
hang it up, so it will dry evenly, when it
will be found to be beautifully frosted.</p>

<p class='c007'>When mixing your color, bear in mind
the more dye and the less shellac the deeper
your tint will be, and vice versa.</p>

<p class='c007'>This method will apply to all colors except
a deep red or deep yellow, when I
recommend the other colorings I have
mentioned, any of which can be removed
with wood alcohol.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>GENERAL ELECTRICAL INSTRUCTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Before proceeding with explanations of
designs requiring special wiring, it is well
for the amateur to become acquainted with
the primary principles of electricity, without
which he is helpless. The following
notes we culled from writings of experienced

<h3 class='c009'>POTENTIAL OR ELECTRO-MOTIVE FORCE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This (commonly E. M. F.) is the term
used for electrical energy or power of doing
work, and is used in the same manner
as “pressure” is applied to steam; in other
words, it is the term used to express the
force which tends to move electricity from
one place to another, and is proportional
to the difference of potential at the two
places.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earth’s surface is called “Zero Potential,”
and is a reference point to measure
the relative condition of other bodies.
A positively electrified body is said to have
a higher potential than the earth, which in
turn has a higher potential than a negatively
electrified body.</p>

<p class='c007'>When two dissimilar metals touch each
other, there is a difference of potential at
point of contact. If zinc is in contact with
copper it is of higher potential. In a series
of disks of copper, zinc and wet cloths, arranged
one over the other in above order,
the wet cloth is the conductor, and current
will flow on joining last copper and zinc
by wire, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>This arrangement is called a voltaic pile
(after its inventor, Volta), and the difference
of potential produced is proportionate
to the number of pairs of disks.</p>

<p class='c007'>A difference of potential between two
points connected will cause current to flow
till the potentials of both points are the
same.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ELECTRIC RESISTANCE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Resistance is offered by all substances to
the electric current, and varies with the nature
of the substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most metals are good conductors; wood
and stone offer considerable resistance, and
silk, glass and ebonite are practical non-conductors;
but remember if a non-conductor
is wet or even damp it becomes a
good conductor, moisture or water being
a first-class conductor. On the other hand,
conductivity is diminished by an increase of
temperature—otherwise dryness. The following
table will give a good idea of the
conductivity of metals:</p>

<table class='table0'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of silver being</td>
    <td class='c015'>100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of copper is</td>
    <td class='c015'>97</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of gold is</td>
    <td class='c015'>74</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of platinum is</td>
    <td class='c015'>17</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of iron is</td>
    <td class='c015'>16</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of lead is</td>
    <td class='c015'>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of German silver is</td>
    <td class='c015'>7.5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>That of mercury is</td>
    <td class='c015'>1.6</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, generally, good conductors
are all the metals, carbon, water, aqueous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>solutions, moist bodies besides wood, cotton,
hemp, etc. Good insulators or non-conductors
are paraffine, solid or liquid, turpentine,
silk, sealing wax, india rubber, dry
glass or porcelain. The best electrical conductors
are the best thermal conductors,
and a “red hot” temperature converts insulators
into fairly good conductors.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ELECTRICAL MEASURES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Electricity being invisible and imponderable
(i. e., not having sensible weight, such
as light, heat or electricity), it is impossible
to apply ordinary standards of measure.
Electricians have devised special units of
measure of two kinds, called absolute units
and practical units, the ratio between the
two being always some power of 10.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been decided in these measurements,
length, mass and time shall be expressed
respectively in centimeters, grams
and seconds—called C. G. S., or centimeter
gram-second method.</p>

<p class='c007'>A gram equals 15.432 grains, a centimeter
0.3937 of an inch. The weight of a
body must not be confused with its mass;
the mass is the amount of matter contained,
while the weight is its specific gravity,
which may be expressed by multiplying
mass by accelerating effect of gravity,
which varies at different parts of the earth’s
surface, and may be averaged at 32.2 feet
(or 981 centimeters) per second.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above absolute units are too large or
too small for practical use, but the following
examples are given:</p>

<p class='c007'>The dyne (absolute unit of force) is that
force which, acting for one second on a
mass of one gram, imparts a velocity of one
centimeter per second.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weight of one gram, as above shown,
is equal to a force of 1 × 981 = 981 dynes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The erg, or absolute unit of work is the
work requisite to move a body of one centimeter
against a force of one dyne.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weight of one gram is equal to 981
dynes, the work of raising one gram one
centimeter, against the force of 981 ergs.</p>

<p class='c007'>An erg is about equal to 1/13,560,000 of
a foot-pound. A foot-pound represents the
work required to raise one pound one foot
high.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practical units of most frequent occurrence
are: The volt, the ohm and the
ampere.</p>

<p class='c007'>The volt, or measure of E. M. F., or difference
of potential, is equal approximately
to the E. M. F. possessed by one “Daniell”
cell; accurately it is 0.95 of the E. M. F.
of a cell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ohm, or measure of resistance (sometimes
called the British Association or B.
A. unit), is approximately equal to the resistance
of 129 yards of copper wire ¹⁄₁₆
inch in diameter, or to 106 centimeters of
mercury, one square millimeter in section.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ampere (formerly called the “Weber”)
is the measure of strength of current.
If an E. M. F. of one volt be applied to
send a current through a resistance of one
ohm, the strength of current will be one
ampere. That is to say, the strength of a
current in amperes varies directly as the
E. M. F. applied to produce it, and inversely
as the resistance of the circuit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The watt or practical unit of work (or
rather, the rate of doing work) is equal to
10,000,000 ergs per second, or to the work
produced in one second by one ampere of
current of an E. M. F. of one volt, acting
through the resistance of one ohm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practical electrical units are called
after the eminent scientific investigators
whose names they bear.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BATTERIES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The portion of the copper plate (or carbon)
from which the current flows through
the wire is called the positive pole (sometimes
anode), and the zinc plate the negative
pole (sometimes cathode).</p>

<p class='c007'>Elements, or the parts that produce current,
are usually understood as the lower
portion of the cell contents, in which the
plates are immersed. When the term
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“pole” is reversed, the zinc being the positive
element, and the copper or carbon the
negative element, it will be noted current
flows from positive pole (copper or carbon)
and returns by the negative (or zinc) pole.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bubbles of hydrogen gas liberated
at the negative element (copper or carbon)
resist the passage of the current, and being
readily oxidizable, will set up an opposing
E. M. F.</p>

<p class='c007'>A battery in this condition is polarized—that
is, neutralized—and must be renewed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The E. M. F. of a cell is equivalent to
the difference of potential between its electrode
when unconnected, and is independent
of the size of the elements, and is determined
solely by the materials of which it is
constructed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference of potential between zinc
and carbon being greater than that between
zinc and copper, a cell of greater E. M. F.
will result from zinc and carbon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cells commonly used for annunciators,
bells, etc., are the “Laclede” and “Laclanche,”
and are generally taken to have
an E. M. F. of one and one-half volts; the
“Danniell,” one volt; others vary from one
to two volts when in good order.</p>

<p class='c007'>To renew these cells fill the jar two-thirds
full of clean water, add six ounces
sal ammoniac, let it dissolve; then put in
the zinc and carbon; be sure they are perfectly
clean; and that the zinc is not worn
out or eaten away. There are two ways to
connect up these cells; the first is “in
series” for E. M. F., the second “in parallel”
for quantity. The first method “in series”
is as shown. This way the E. M. F.
is in proportion to the number of cells, three
cells having three times the E. M. F. of one
volt.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_113a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second method, “in parallel” for
quantity, is as shown; all the negatives
(zinc) are connected, and all the positives
(carbon) connected, making the current obtained
of much greater volume, but only
of the E. M. F. or intensity of one cell.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_113b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The strength of a current given by a
battery varies with the resistance, as well
as with the E. M. F., and can be increased
not only by adding more cells “in series,”
but also by lessening the internal resistance,
viz., by increasing the size of battery
plates, or more simply by coupling all the
+ (positive) poles together, and all the -
(negative) poles together. The E. M. F.
of cells coupled in this way is only equal
to that of a single cell, but the current will
be greater because the internal resistance
will be only one-third that of a single cell.
This plan is called coupling up for quantity,
or “in parallel,” to distinguish it from
the plan of “in series,” or for intensity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The E. M. F. of a large and small cell are
both the same (using same size elements).
To increase E. M. F. multiply the cells “in
series.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ordinary battery carbon is a mixture
of carbon and peroxide of manganese—“Oh,
Mr. Window Trimmer, please see if
you can make this bell ring.” Bell No. 7
is dead, and there is no end of trouble;
this is something met with occasionally.
Examine the battery, see that it has not become
crystallized (polarized), and if so, disconnect
one cell at a time. Clean it well,
without wetting the outside of jar, recharge
with new zinc (if required) and six ounces
powdered sal ammoniac, jar being first
filled two-thirds full of warm water, or
enough to avoid overflow; replace cell,
connect up and take out another. Be sure
to reconnect the cells left in battery, so as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>to keep it working while you are cleaning
each one. A good way, if you don’t think
the cells need changing, is to take a small
call bell or buzzer, with short wires, disconnect
both ends of battery, then test every
cell by placing a wire on each pole of the
cell at same time. If cell is all right, bell
will ring. Suppose you find cells all right,
proceed to bell No. 7, the dead one, examine
the push button, and trace the wires
from bell to battery, being sure they are not
grounded by lying on some steam or gas
pipe with the insulation worn off. (If it
should be a case of continual ringing, the
wires are crossed.) You may expect a
“ground” if the battery has run down suddenly
or too quick. If the trouble is found
in the annunciator, don’t bother with it,
unless you are expert or want trouble.
Send for an electrician; it will save time—in
other words, money.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SPECIAL WINDOW WIRING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Many houses have ample facilities for
electrical work, but as they do not employ
a house electrician many beautiful and attractive
effects are barred in their windows.
Even when an attempt is made to introduce
electrical effects into displays the results are
tame and insignificant, because of a lack of
special wiring. Yet we know that the success
of many windows depends largely
upon their illumination.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some mercantile establishments the
trimmer has an electrician at his beck and
call, and when a design is ready he simply
pushes the button and Mr. Electrician does
the rest. But I know that these are exceptional
cases, and that in the majority of
establishments the trimmer is thrown upon
his own resources, and has no one to help
him out of his difficulties. And if he is not
posted on electrical appliances, his designs
are not properly illuminated—a deficiency
that annoys the conscientious trimmer as
much as it does his employer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Electricity, properly applied, is an important
factor in selling goods through the
show window. Therefore the window trimmer
who understands wiring his own windows
is a more valuable man to his employer
than one without this knowledge. I
shall endeavor to be plain and avoid the
use of unnecessary technical terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt your windows have permanent
lights. The first thing to do is to have a
switch or “cut-out” run in for special work.
Any electrician will do this for you in an
hour or so, and it saves you from tapping
your permanent wires, which should never
be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Be sure to ascertain the voltage and amperes;
or, to be plainer, find out how many
lights your “cut-out” will carry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before you begin work you must have
proper tools to work with, and sufficient
supplies to meet any case of emergency.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ELECTRICAL TOOLS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The following is a list of tools required:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Pair of nippers to cut and twist wire.</div>
      <div class='line'>Brace and bit.</div>
      <div class='line'>Screw driver.</div>
      <div class='line'>An old pocket knife.</div>
      <div class='line'>Burner. (Similar to that used by painters to burn off paint.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That is not a formidable list, nor difficult
to procure; but each item is necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>STANDARD ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The list of supplies you should keep on
hand is as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No. 10 or No. 12 insulated wire.</div>
      <div class='line'>Insulating tape.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bushing.</div>
      <div class='line'>Clay bushings.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sockets.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lamps.</div>
      <div class='line'>Porcelain knobs.</div>
      <div class='line'>Solder.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This last item you can get prepared with
resin, and it needs no acid to make it adhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>No quantities are specified in the list.
Your judgment will enable you to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>how much you will need or can use
to advantage.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ARCS AND INCANDESCENTS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps I would better explain here the
difference between arc and incandescent
wiring. If we had a row of arc lights to
put up we could run our wires as in Fig. 1.
The current going to the first light passes
through to the next, and so on until it
reaches the last light, when it returns to the
dynamo.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_115a.jpg' alt='Fig. 1. Fig. 2. Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Fig. 5.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With incandescents we run two wires
parallel, and make our connections as in
Fig. 2. This is called “multiple arc.” Each
lamp is independent of the others, and if
one “dies” the current passes through the
others uninterrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose you have a “cut-out” of 110
volts, carrying sixteen or twenty lamps, and
wish to run six lamps on a strip. (This is
figurative, and only used to demonstrate,
for you can use any number up to the capacity
of your switch.) You proceed as follows:
Lay out the place for each lamp.
Bore two holes the size of bushings, and between
each two lamps place two knobs, as
in Fig. 3. Cut two pieces of wire, long
enough for all the lights, allowing enough
extra to knot each knob and for the last
lamp, and also leaving enough to reach the
switch. Fasten the wire to the knobs nearest
the last lamp, as in Fig. 4. Stretch
tightly to the next knob, and repeat until
the wire is all laid. For each lamp remove
about one and one-half inches of insulation
on each wire. Take pieces of wire five
inches long for connections, and remove
one and one-half inches of insulation from
the ends of each. Twist these ends tightly
around your lead wires, as in Fig. 5, and
solder them. The simplest way to solder
is to heat your exposed wires until they are
hot enough to melt the solder when it is
held against them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let me say here that when I have laid
out my wires, and marked my connections,
I then unloose the wires, make my cross-connections
and replace them. It takes
time, but it is easier, and is the proper way
to work.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the soldering is finished take your
tape and carefully wrap each exposed wire.
Then through each hole put a piece of bushing,
and run your connections through the
bushings. Run the two ends through for
the last lamp. No short wires are attached
for these, and your work should now appear
as in Fig. 6.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_115b.jpg' alt='Fig. 6. Fig. 7.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then you are ready for your lamps.
Turn the strip over and fasten the sockets
in place, positive sides all on the same edge
of your strip. Cut the connecting wires the
required length and remove one-half inch
of insulation from the ends. Loosen the
brass screws, place the ends of the wires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>under them, and fasten down. Fig. 7 shows
one side of socket connected. Attach brass
hoops and rubber rings, and you are all
ready for placing and connecting. It is
probably unnecessary to state that the same
principles above explained will enable one
to place lights in circles, horseshoes or any
other designs that may be required. Once
you know how to wire a window, a great
field of operations is open to you.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE FUSE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The next important step in show window
wiring is the proper fusing of circuits. The
fuse is to the lighting wire what the safety
valve is to the steam boiler. A fuse is composed
of a fusible metal, which contains
lead, zinc, etc., and becomes fusible at a
certain degree of temperature. The fuse is
supposed to be “the watch dog” of safety.
Ninety-five per cent of the electrical fires
are caused by improper fusing.</p>

<p class='c007'>My advice to the amateur is to apply to
the nearest office of the National Board of
Fire Underwriters for a copy of the rules
on incandescent wiring. They may be obtained
for the asking.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE TRANSFORMER.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Usually the electric fluid (?) is conveyed
into the building from the alley, where the
high tension wires are strung, carrying a
pressure of 2,500 to 3,500 volts from this
line. By the aid of a “transformer” the current
is reduced to a pressure of 110, 105 or
50 volts, as required, entering the building,
when it is conveyed to a double-pole switch;
that is, a switch which cuts off both positive
and negative wires at the same instant.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_116.jpg' alt='TRANSFORMER.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The “transformer” is a device for reducing
the current from one potential or
tension to another, and consists of a ring
of many turns of insulated wire; the high
tension wire is then wound around and
through this ring several turns, and the low
tension wire carrying the current into the
building is wound around the opposite side
of the ring in like manner. The difference
in pressure is controlled by the number of
turns around the ring on either side, as
shown.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the wires being insulated, the reduction
is made by “induction” only. The size
of the wire makes no difference in the voltage
or pressure, but it makes all the difference
in the “amperes” or quantity used to
supply the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>The electric light company will supply a
sufficiently large wire from transformer to
switch; the firm does the remainder of the
wiring.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FEEDERS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>From this large double-pole switch
(which is the main cut-off) radiate “feeder”
wires to the various parts of the building,
to supply the lamp circuits. These feeders
have to be carefully gauged according to
the number of lamps, or rather, amperes,
they are required to carry, in order to avoid
resistance in the wire; or in other words,
must not crowd the carrying capacity of
the wire, or the resistance will make the
wire hot and might cause fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>A “feeder” to the circuits for fifty incandescent
16-candle power lamps should be
of somewhat higher capacity, say a No. 10
Brown &#38; Thorp Gauge (B. &#38; S. G.) which
has a safe carrying capacity of thirty-two
amperes or sixty-four 16-candle power
lamps, allowing one-half ampere to each
lamp; a No. 12 B. &#38; S. G. wire is allowed
to carry twenty-three amperes, or about
forty-five 16-candle power lamps; No. 13
B. &#38; S. G. wire is allowed to carry sixteen
amperes, or about thirty 16-candle power
amps.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “feeder” should have considerably
more carrying capacity than is required in
order to permit the addition of extra lights,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>as occasion may require, and to provide for
the addition of extra window lights, if there
be not a special feeder for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feeder wires are tapped for lamp circuits
by a branch block carrying a fuse for
the protection of the circuit. The construction
and operation of the branch block, or
cut-out, will be understood at once on inspection.
The fuse here is the important
part; it must be of smaller carrying capacity
than the wire it is to protect, and not
depend upon the amount of current in the
feeder; thus, a No. 10 B. &#38; S. G. might be
protected with a 20-ampere fuse (forty
lamps, sixteen candle power), or with a 25-ampere
fuse, leaving a margin of seven amperes,
the wire being allowed to carry
thirty-two amperes. It will be understood
that “open work” is meant in every case,
and wires that are concealed are not allowed
to carry so much. The No. 12 wire
B. &#38; S. G. is allowed twenty-three amperes,
and would be protected by fuse of fifteen to
twenty amperes capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lamp circuits from feeders are in
many cities restricted to a certain number
of amperes, usually six to ten, or say from
ten to twenty lamps (sixteen candle power).
Each of these circuits must be protected by
its own fuse and have an independent
switch. All fuse boxes must have their
porcelain cover kept on, and no inflammable
material allowed near them. “Twin
wires,” or two wires encased, are objectionable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drop cords are not allowed except for
drop lamps, and must be protected by one-ampere
fuse in rosette or cut-out. All wires
where joined must be soldered—to prevent
an arc forming by making the path of the
current continuous or tight.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well for the beginner to know that
a current of 110 volts does not kill, though
it might make the recipient seriously ill.
Therefore, be careful not to get yourself in
the path of the current. Never touch both
naked ends or openings in wires at the same
time, nor stand upon the ground while
working live wires. Always stand on some
non-conductor, a dry board, for instance.
The inexpert can always protect himself by
disconnecting a fuse behind him both sides;
or, better, open the “main cut-off” or first
switch.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CONNECTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>When your design is wired and set up in
your window, your next step is to connect
it to your “cut-out.” You will find two
wires leading from it; to these you connect
the two wires leading from your design.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not necessary to solder this connection;
simply remove sufficient insulation
and twist the wires together tightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a way to do this that every one
should know, and I will tell you how to
make a</p>

<h3 class='c009'>WESTERN UNION HITCH.</h3>

<p class='c010'>After removing the insulation from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>wires at the ends to be connected, bend the
wires as in Fig. 1, lay them together as in
Fig. 2, then with a pair of pliers hold one
side, and with another pair twist the end
around the lead wire tightly and closely, as
in Fig. 3. When this is done hold the
twisted wires with pliers and repeat the
twisting process on the other side. This
is a perfectly safe connection, and does not
waste electricity as does a loose joint.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>DIFFERENT VOLTAGES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes it happens that your electric
system is of higher voltage than you need
use in special work; for instance, you may
have a 220-volt circuit, whereas 110-volt
lamps are amply strong for your work; or
again, you have a 110-volt circuit, and want
to use a number of small lamps, 1-candle
power, for example.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are usually of lower voltage, fifty-five
or thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these instances we resort to a method
known as wiring in series, which is done as
in Fig. 4.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course the number of lamps to a series
is to be governed entirely by the voltage,
and the trimmer must resort to his own
judgment in determining this.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will see by the diagram in Fig. 4
that you have two lights for each connection
with your lead wires, therefore, if
using a 220-volt circuit and 110-volt lamps
you have each connection using the full 220
volts, otherwise your lamps would soon
burn out, as every connection must consume
as many volts as your circuit carries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Special Designs.—These few instructions
answer for a single string of lights, such as
a circle, arch, cornice, etc., where your leads
run uninterruptedly from first to last lamp;
but “how about a design that is impossible
to wire that way?” you ask. It is simple,
and I have made a few diagrams to illustrate
the method employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>You may have a cornice about your windows,
and must bring your wires from the
corner. Fig. 5 will show how to do it. A
cross, or such designs as have two breaks,
are wired as in Fig. 6.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_118.jpg' alt='Fig. 5 Fig. 6 Fig. 7 Fig. 8' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Again, you may wish to use more than
one design in a window; for example, you
may have three circles, one at back and one
at either side. Fig. 7 shows the easiest
method.</p>

<p class='c007'>These principles apply to many varieties
of designs, and it is only the principles I
am endeavoring to make plain.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now I will give a few hints or, better
yet, some don’ts which will be valuable
for amateurs.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SOME “DON’TS.”</h3>

<p class='c010'>Don’t be negligent in handling your connections.
Insulate every joint, and don’t
leave loose joints; they consume too much
current.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t cross wires that are insulated without
bushing the overlying wires, and never
cross uncovered wires.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Don’t bring a wire through the floor or
back of window without using clay bushings;
that’s what they are for.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t run wires (as in Fig. 8) without
using a lamp, or cutting wires where X is
marked; it saves a short circuit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t let the wires to your lamps touch
brass, except under the screw.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t attempt to connect your design to
your “cut-out” until you are sure your
switch is open. You may short circuit
yourself. It is not necessarily fatal, but is
decidedly unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t handle live wires; 110 volts won’t
kill you, but through carelessness you may
some day touch a stronger circuit. Practice
caution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t leave an uncovered wire to show
in your window. If you suspend a design,
wrap the wires with the same color as your
background.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t imagine you are an electrician because
you can run a string of lights. Keep
digging away; you’ll learn something every
day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t try to do all kinds of joint soldering
by heating the wires merely. When
you become a little more accustomed to the
work, get a larger tool kit, and among the
first things get a soldering iron. In many
places it is necessary.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LETTERS IN ELECTRIC LIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c010'>In the following illustrations are shown
plans of a sign to be electrically illuminated.
The electrical work is necessarily done in
the electric working shops, but as many illuminated
signs are being used nowadays,
the description may be useful to decorators
who contemplate putting in something of
the kind. In the first figure the letter is on
a casing, A, having a back or support carrying
incandescent lamps in channels. The
form of the letter is sheet metal and is set-screwed
to the base piece at the places
marked C. The disks B are plate glass colored
to conform to the requirements. The
commutator is shown in the other figures.
In the first, E is a wood cylinder, which
turns in bearings, D. F F are spring contractors,
and G G wire connections which
join those of the lights. Another view is in
the next drawing, in which the cylinder is
B, bearings D and spring contractors C.
The cylinder is driven by a small electric
motor, G, through a reduction gear, consisting
of a train of wheels or worm gearing,
as at F and E. The spring contacts are
electrically joined to the terminals of the
lights. The terminals are joined by a combined
return to one pole of the source of
electric supply, and the other pole is connected
to the contact pieces. The rotation
of the cylinder consequently breaks and
joins the circuit as desired, producing alternate
changing of the lights and colors,
resulting in attractive effects.</p>

be operated with water, motor or electricity;
but where electricity is used it becomes
necessary to reduce speed of motor (which
is 2,200 revolutions) to about 40 or 50 revolutions;
this is done by building the reducer
as shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 3 shows machine made at an outlay
of labor only. Procure six tobacco pail
lids, join them face to face with screws and

a machine on which you can operate from 1
to 100 incandescent lamps alternately.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Weber commutator is very inexpensive,
and has been made by a decorator with
an outlay of only fifty cents for the three
parts.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE REYNOLDS FLASHER.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The most reliable machine we now have
is one manufactured by a Chicago firm,
which is perfect in its construction and operation
and will not break down or cause
danger from sparks. The expense is about
fifteen dollars and the adjustment is so easy
that any one can operate it.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A CHEAP HUB SWITCH.</h3>

<p class='c010'>No doubt every one has seen revolving
wheels, stars, pyramids, spiral stairs, etc.,
strung with lights, and many have envied
the man who had the facilities for this
work; but by following these instructions
they can make an appliance that will do the
work perfectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>First make a pulley wheel twelve inches
in diameter; then make two circles of one-inch
wood six inches in diameter; nail together
and fasten in exact center of pulley;
insulate the 6-inch circles perfectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next take two strips of spring copper
three-eighths inch wide, and make two
hoops to fit snugly over the insulation and
to each hoop fasten a wire eighteen inches
long; then put your hoops on your 6-inch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>circles about one inch apart, taking care to
have them even and tight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bore a hole through pulley wheel, and
run wire from hoop nearest it through hole;
then bore a hole through 6-inch circles and
pulley, and run the other wire through it.
Use bushings in holes, and insulate uncovered
wires. Next take two pieces of copper
three-eighths inch wide, six inches long,
bend in half circles, attach wire to end of
each, fasten to a piece of 1×2, so they will
form contacts with copper bands on circles.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 1 shows band of copper, two half
circles on 1 × 2, and pulley when finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now suppose you want to use revolving
wheel on pivot. Fasten your appliance in
center of wheel, run wires from lamps to
wires running through pulley and connect
them; then when your wheel is in position,
fasten piece of wood with two half circles
so each presses tightly on one of the copper
bands; connect the wires from half circles
to wires from switch, and as your wheel revolves
you have a steady contact.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fig. 2 shows front of wheel, and 3 shows
wheel from rear with half circles in position.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a pyramid or such fixtures simply
fasten your appliance to bottom or top as
serves your purpose best.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make your work as near perfect as possible,
so the half circles never leave the
bands, and exercise great care in insulating,
for, while neglect does not always result
disastrously it is well to be on the safe side.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE RUBENS DOUBLE-REVOLVING EFFECT.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_121b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The idea is novel and simple. The construction
of this machine is inexpensive.
Go to any machine shop and have them
bore out a piece of shafting so that one will
fit into the other snugly. The contact
plates are made of copper, lined with asbestos,
mounted on wooden circles. In
fact, the entire machine can be built for
$12. There is no limit to designs that can
be made for this arrangement. The novelty
of two large pieces revolving in opposite
directions, apparently from the point of
a single shaft, is in itself a worthy attraction
in any window. You will observe in
photo that there are two pulleys on main
shaft, also a countershaft below. One belt
is up straight, the other belt is twisted so as
to reverse either shaft. The large pulley on
the countershaft is the main driver. The
belt attached to this pulley leads to your
motor or whatever power you wish to employ.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>This device is safe as well as simple,
as you have ample room for cut-outs.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE TYLER AUTOMATIC SWITCH.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A is a wooden cylinder, twelve inches
long and six inches in diameter. B is brush
made of three layers of copper, and is
screwed down at lower end, No. 1, so as to
work as a spring. C is piece of copper one-half
inch wide fastened around cylinder, and
comes in contact with B, so as to make
one feed wire run to switch. D is piece of
copper running one-third of the way
around, and comes in contact with another
brush, E. Then fasten a small piece of
wire from C to D that carries the current
to No. 2, while E is on copper. The other
feed wire is direct from main circuit to
window. F is pulley wheel running to reducer.
No. 3 is fuse blocks, which can be
used and are much safer than without. This
switch cost me twenty-five cents. Of
course, I am my own electrician. It will
cost no more to any one, as it is very simple.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC WAVING FLAG.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This would appear to the uninitiated as
a hard one to build, yet it is one of the
simplest electrical devices to construct.</p>

<p class='c007'>First ascertain size of flag you want to
make, as there is no limit to size. Build the
body of your flag of thin boards, say half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>an inch thick. The next important thing
is to outline on your woodwork an exact
flag. Be sure you get the requisite number
of stars and stripes. You are now ready
to proceed to fasten on your sockets. I
may further add here, the flag should not
be square. Have a wave running through
your stripes; saw out your edges (see cut)
accordingly. You now have the general
outline, as far as the flag is concerned.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>REAR VIEW OF THE WAVING FLAG.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Now, then, for the mechanical part of it:
Saw out two wooden disks, twelve inches
in diameter, with a ⅞-in hole in the center.
Next you procure a piece of slate,
fourteen inches square. Take a compass
and strike a 12-inch circle. By drawing
your compass around several times, you
will find it will cut a fairly deep line. You
can then take a hammer and by a few light
taps break the square edges of your slate,
leaving a perfectly round disk of slate.
Next, you want a ⅞-inch hole in the center
of the slate. Now mount this on the
wooden disk; next, cut the copper contacts
and shape them the same as a keystone.
It will require fifteen of them for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>that number of circuits. To each one of
them solder a piece of No. 14 wire, as shown
in cut G. Then bore the holes in the slate
so that the wires will go through the back
of the disks, as each wire must run from
the disk to the flag; that is the negative
side, and the positive side runs right
straight from your feeder to the flag. For
your second wooden disk cut out a copper
ring, two inches wide, and fasten it securely
to the wood, and solder your wire on the
back of this, say a No. 8 wire. This will
need contacts, as shown in cut E.</p>

<p class='c007'>You next make a brush holder. This is
a very simple arrangement. The holder is
made of wood. Fasten brushes on securely,
as shown in F of cut. When automatic
switch is set up, it will appear as shown in
cut E. Now fasten belt to pulley J, and
then to motor, as shown in cut. This switch
should make 300 revolutions per minute.
As the brushes strike each section on the
contact plate, it causes a wave of light to
pass through that section of stripes or stars,
as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c007'>This may seem complicated and difficult,
but I will venture to say, if you will study
this ten or fifteen minutes you can without
much difficulty or expense proceed to duplicate
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remember, each wire running from the
disk must run into cut-out and from cut-out
to the flag (see cut B). Also note how wire
is soldered on in G. You can bunch and
group all wires from A, and form them
into a cable, as shown in cut I, as they are
all of one polarity.</p>

<p class='c007'>This description is for flag 4½ × 6 feet, to
contain about 450 lamps. There are a number
of different ways of producing this effect,
but I have tried this one as described,
and found it very satisfactory, likewise inexpensive
to construct.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ELECTRIC ILLUMINATED FOUNTAIN.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A really beautiful center feature, with the
addition of a few potted plants, a little moss
and some pebbles.</p>

<p class='c007'>How to construct it: First, have a tinsmith
make the center bowl A out of tin,
any size you wish, according to your window.
This resembles a large cake tin, hollow
in the center. Have it enameled white
(it will not cost very much). Then cut a
hole in the center of your window; place
this tin over the hole; secure a circular
glass shelf, B, from any ordinary notion or
perfumery counter stand; put a large rubber
band around the center tin cone and
rest the glass shelf B upon it. Have a
fancy stem, C, made of tin and enameled
white and soldered to water pipe, which
passes through the hole in center of glass
shelf B, and is attached to main pipe in the
basement. A rubber washer on the glass
shelf makes it water tight. Fine holes are
punched into the stem, C, at top and bottom.
The water flow is regulated by water
stop. The surplus is carried off through
waste pipe. The skeleton pulley D is arranged
so that half of it is in center of the
fountain. In the four openings of pulley
are four pieces of colored glass, red, green,
yellow and blue, held in position by tacks.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strong electric light with reflector, F,
sends its rays through the colored glass upward
and through the center cone on to the
water, giving a very beautiful effect. The
changing of the colors can be reduced in
speed by means of the reducer E. Three
electric bulbs, colored green, with wires
made waterproof, are well insulated and enameled
white and laid in the lower bowl.
A few pond lilies and gold fish, together
with other accessories suggested, makes a
magnificent center feature.</p>

<p class='c010'>First the outlines of the trees are painted
on heavy board and cut out, as are the
“wings” in a scene at the theater. A village,
with a pretty scene, houses and
churches in the distance, etc., is then painted,
and the profile of the steeples, chimneys,
gables, etc., also cut out. About two inches
back of this is set a frame in which is puffed
a sunburst of white china silk. Behind this,
again at a distance of two inches, is set another
frame covered with tissue paper, as is
shown in the next diagram.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_125b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A short distance back of this tissue frame
is placed a window glass, as a protection to
the paper from the electric lights, twenty-four
of which were hung in circular forms
back of all, the lights following the form of
the sunburst. The effect is simply gorgeous,
the silk sunburst taking all the tintings of
the tissue paper screen and the colors
blending in perfect harmony, from the rosy
tints of the rising sun to the deep purple
tones of the sky. It puzzles observers to
know how this brilliant effect is created;
but you know how to do it now, and can
try it yourself. It will be sure to attract

<p class='c010'>This consists in cutting the form of the
octopus from dark fabric, and stitching it
to a white cloth. The scales can be made on
the octopus with black paint. The eyes
should be cut out, and pink cloth or paper
pasted over the openings on the back of the
cloth. Then a number of cards should be
obtained from white board, and the letters
of various inscriptions cut out with a sharp
knife. A few suggestive cards are shown in
the sketch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The top card is simply pinned above the
form of the octopus, and the several little
cards are entwined in the arms. Colored
paper, or cloth, is glued to the back of each

<h3 class='c009'>OLD DUTCH WINDMILL WITH CHANGEABLE COLORS AND FLASHER EFFECTS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The design here submitted is one that
will attract attention as far as it can be seen,
and requires nothing practically of a special
order, and is applicable to almost any
kind of stock. The first proceeding naturally
will be the frame for the mill house (see
Fig. 2). For a design, say five and one-half
feet high, let this be four feet high to
top, eighteen inches square at the gables,
two feet square at the base, made of stock
say 1 × 3 inches, and strong enough to
stand the weight and vibrations of the revolving
wheel. About three feet from the
floor put in two cross pieces for the bearings
for the wheel. The frame can either
be covered with painted canvas or filled in
with boxes of shoes or corsets, bolts of
ribbon, etc., or covered with white cloth
pinned full of bunches of flowers or other
millinery goods. The wheel (see Fig. 1) is
made of two pieces of 1 × 3 wood, five feet
long, crossed at right angles in the center,
and be careful to have it securely fastened
to a substantial hub, in case you cannot get
the flange described further on.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_128c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wings for the wheel can be made of
lath frames, say eight inches wide at the top,
six inches at the bottom, and twenty-two
inches long, covered the same as you decide
to cover the mill house, and provision
made for the lamps projecting through
when the lamp sockets are screwed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>1 × 3-inch pieces behind. Next is the shaft,
as shown in Fig. 3. Get a piece of gas pipe
eight inches longer than your frame is
square at the bearings, screw it securely into
a 3-inch flange, which in turn is screwed
to the center of the wheel and acts as a hub.
Parallel with the shaft, in its center, fasten
two strips of ¼-inch wood, opposite each
other (see Fig. 4), and about one foot long.
Next make nine rings of ¹⁄₁₆ × ½-inch
brass, whose inside diameter will be such
as to cause them to fit snugly over the
wooden strips on the shaft, about one-quarter
inch apart. Thus you will see the duty
of the strips is to hold the rings away from
the shaft, and allow the intervening space
under the rings for drawing in the wires.
To ring No. 9 connect a wire running to
one side of each circuit on the wheel, and
known as the return wire. (See Fig. 6.)
Connect ring No. 8 to circuit No. 8 on the
wheel, No. 7 ring to No. 7 circuit, etc.
These wires must all be run under the rings,
so as to leave their face unobstructed, and
at the point of the shaft bearing they must
run inside the shaft and out again at the
flange. Attach a 5-inch pulley anywhere,
put on a collar to prevent lateral motion,
and the shaft is completed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_129c.jpg' alt='Fig. 6.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Next nail a 1 × 2-inch strip, covered with
asbestos, across the frame (see Fig. 5), parallel
with the shaft and one-half inch clearance
from the rings. This is for a bridge
to support the brushes, which project up
and press on the rings to form a contact.
Make the brushes of thin brass, three inches
long, and set one opposite and in line with
each ring, and screw to the bridge. Each
brush will be known by the same number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>as its corresponding ring. Shaft brush No.
9 connects to the service main direct; shaft
brush No. 8 connects to flasher brush No.
8; shaft brush No. 7 connects to flasher
brush No. 7, and so on. Place your flasher
in such position that you can belt direct
from a 1¼-inch pulley on the countershaft
of your flasher to the 5-inch pulley on the
shaft of the windmill with a quarter-inch
leather belt. Divide the flasher circumference
into twelve parts. Arrange the lugs
as shown in Fig. 7. Connect and start the
motor, and the following will be produced:</p>

<p class='c007'>It is possible, with the above, to make
1,620 combinations, but I wouldn’t advise
you to try it just yet. It is also possible to
use fewer circuits if you wish, and get good
results; but I have chosen the above as giving
the best results for the labor expended.
I have previously told how lamps can be
colored for this kind of work.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ELECTRIC REVOLVING CHRISTMAS TREE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This is an excellent window feature for
the holidays, or it would make a beautiful
interior display for the toy department.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of trimming the tree with the old
style glass bells, use colored electric lights
and have the tree revolving.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost is very small, and can be quickly
constructed, and when artistically trimmed
with toys, etc., makes a very beautiful feature.</p>

<p class='c007'>How to go about it: First, secure a good
shaped tree, the size you wish to use, A.
Then trim off the limbs at the bottom; cut
a hole through the floor in the center of
window; put the bottom of tree through
this hole, resting the end upon a revolving
counter stool D. See that it is well oiled.
If you have no stool, use any suitable pivot.
Smooth around the tree below the limbs;
put plenty of graphite on and nail a collar
to the window floor. This will make a good
bearing. Next get a split pulley B, and fix
around the tree. This connects with motor.
If you wish to reduce the speed, make a
reducer, as shown in electric fountain drawing
in last chapter. The wiring is of the
simplest kind, and has already been thoroughly
explained. Be careful to insulate
well all connections. C shows block of
wood with brushes attached. The strips of
copper nailed on pulley B show the contact
and cut-off. You can use as many or as few
lights as you wish. To color the bulbs, use
Pikron for glass, which comes in all colors.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>This is so simple in construction that any
amateur will grasp the idea readily. It is an
excellent Christmas attraction.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A SHIP IN A STORM.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This was a prize design of Leonard Shogran’s
invention, and depicts in the foreground
a well-rigged ship with the name
“Monarch” painted on her bow and stern
was nobly laboring in the heavy seas, with
a motion so accurately perfect that many
interested spectators stepped on the window
sash in hopes to see actual waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every five or six seconds a vivid flash of
lightning burst forth from the sullen,
stormy clouds, with such surprising reality
one would invariably wait to hear the crashing
thunder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mechanical contrivance used to obtain
the above described effect is very simple
and inexpensive. A painted scene on
canvas represents a storm on the water,
about 5 × 7 feet in size, covered on back
with cardboard, making it perfectly opaque.
Then cut out streaks representing lightning,
and also openings in the edges of the
clouds bending them forward enough to
admit the light from behind. Then paste
white tissue paper back of openings representing
lightning, and yellow and orange
back of clouds. Then place an incandescent
lamp behind, which is turned on and off
every few seconds by an automatic switch.</p>

<p class='c007'>To produce the flickering effect, wherein
the real novelty consists, place a large
wheel, made of cardboard and thin strips of
wood, divided into eight equal open and
closed spaces, between the canvas and lamp,
which, when set in motion, throws a rapid
string of shadows, caused by the closed
space. This wheel, as will be understood,
was always in motion; so that the moment
the lamp was lit the effect was there; and
when it went out everything seemed dead
and quiet, as no trace of the revolving wheel
could then be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The effective motion of the ship was obtained
by an equally simple device, as can
be seen in the drawing. The ship was first
painted on cardboard, and cut out and fastened
on a rod operated by a wheel below.
The different speeds necessary for these effects
was obtained by a series of pulleys, the
arrangement of which you will find illustrated
in the drawing.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A MOONLIGHT SCENE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This novel effect, as shown in the picture,
is a pleasing centerpiece to any class of displayed
goods. The background was a scene,
painted in oil colors on a 7 × 9 canvas, of a
rough, “choppy” sea, the water in natural
colors, the sky nearly black, except where
the edges of the clouds are lit up by the rising
moon. At the horizon a hole is cut for
moon, and beneath that, and all the way
down to bottom of the canvas, little slits
were cut in the crests of the waves, the
width of space in which slits were cut widening
while going downward. White celluloid
was glued to back of moon and also
all the slits, and back of celluloid yellow tissue
paper was glued. On front of canvas
edges of slits were tipped with gilt and silver
metal flitters sprinkled liberally between.
Divide the canvas into two parts
by cutting through where the sky line and
water meet. Each part was mounted on
a frame, the water part put on very loosely,
allowing three or four inches play. When
set up the water canvas laps over the sky
a trifle, and is set one-half inch forward to
allow sail to pass through, which is a piece
of cardboard painted gray, and fastened on
an endless band. An incandescent light is
placed back of moon, also one lower down,
back of slits, and an electric fan stood back
of water canvas. When set in motion the
sail projects through and passes across the
canvas between the two frames at the horizon,
and the canvas on water frame being
loose, the fan gives it a pitching, rolling motion.
When seen from sidewalk no division
of canvas is detected, and the illusion of the
moving sail and rolling waters, reflecting
the moon’s light, is perfect. This arrangement
is so simple and easy that any one can
do it, and it is bound to be an overwhelming
attraction anywhere. This display was the
invention of Oscar M. Condit.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>AN ALLEGORICAL DESIGN.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_135b.jpg' alt='Fig. 1.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In giving a description of this allegorical
effect you will at once see that it is on the
“theatrical” order. A great many of our
merchants have ideas of their own in regard
to the value of decorations of this kind—in
fact, we know of a merchant who will not
allow a wax figure in his windows, another
who considers a landscape effect abominable,
another who will not allow contrasting
backgrounds, and so on without end. The
fact remains, nevertheless, that the writer
believes show windows were made for the
purpose of showing goods, that the people
may see what you have and patronize you
accordingly. It is with the intention of giving
you a show window distinctively attractive
in itself, that can be gotten up at a trifling
expense and possess sufficient animation
to attract the attention of the public,
that the accompanying design is presented.
It is suitable for almost any line of goods,
and requires no materials outside of the
average property room, unless it be the
flasher; but as these are now so much used
we assume you have one either of your own
make, such as has been previously described,
or one of the many for sale on the market.
Outside of this you will require fourteen
red, fourteen white and seven green lamps
for the figure and border, and the necessary
amount of stationary lights to show off the
goods displayed properly, but not strong
enough to dim the colors of the figure.
Next select a suitable life-size figure, mount
it on a pedestal about one foot high, and
drape in any filmy white material you may
have. Set the figure somewhat back on the
pedestal, so as to leave room for three footlights
of different colors in front, which can
be screened from the outside by a piece of
new tin set at such angle as to reflect the
colored rays upon the white figure, and
properly covered up on the side toward the
street. The sword may be made of a piece
of lath covered with silver paper or white
cloth. For the girdle use a modern stock
article, and a limited amount of tinsel properly
distributed will improve the looks of
the entire window. For the wings take two
thin sticks extending from the bottom of
the wings below the hips to the extreme tip.
Draw it into the shape of a bow, with a
string attached to each end, the same as a
small boy would make a bow. About two-thirds
of the way down, at a point just behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the shoulders nail a piece of board
about 6 × 12 inches. Now take a number
of lath, saw them in two parts lengthwise
and nail to this board, diverging in the direction
shown in the cut forming the frame
for the wings. They are to be covered with
a transparent white material for two reasons:
The lights on the wings are behind
the cloth, showing through (not in front),
and it must be white because there are colored
lamps to be shown through it. The
covering on the wings should be properly
gathered and pleated to give the appearance
of feathers, in the same direction as the diverging
ribs. A very thin shellac (almost
watery with alcohol) colored with aniline
makes a very good dip for coloring lamps
for temporary inside work. Use very little
aniline, as deep colors do not give the desired
effect. The background can be made
of panels about one foot wide and eight
long, all converging to the center. In this
case, however, it will be found better to put
the lamps studding the panels on the front
side. The panels can be made of all white
or alternate white and delicate pink, with
lights therein to correspond. Behind the
whole about two feet put a purple background
perfectly plain—at least from the
level of the hips up, if not entirely.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_136a.jpg' alt='Fig. 2.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wiring is done according to Fig. 2.
Circuit No. 1 connects to each alternate
light in the border which are to be red; No.
2 goes to each alternate light in the border
which will be white; No. 3 to one red footlight
and three red lights in each wing; No.
4 to one white footlight and three white in
each wing. No. 5 to one green footlight
and three green lights in each wing. While
but one line is shown in the cut, it will be
understood that two wires are required.
Now take the left hand wire of each of the
five circuits and connect them to the left
hand service main, using a fuse in each.
Take the right hand wire of circuit No. 1
and connect to the left hand brush of flasher,
the right hand wire of No. 2 to the next
brush, and so on. Connect the right hand
service to the standard of the flasher.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_136b.jpg' alt='Fig. 3.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Next divide the circumference of your
flasher into six equal parts, and arrange the
lugs as shown in Fig. 3. Set the speed of
the flasher at about one revolution per minute,
and the following effect will be produced:</p>

<p class='c007'>First.—Red and white border, with green
wings and footlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second.—Red border, with red and white
wings and footlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third.—All white.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth.—All red.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifth.—White border, green wings and
footlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sixth.—All lamps at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above movements will be repeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>every minute, and the current consumed
is about 55 per cent of the capacity of the
lamps burning steadily.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='c008'>PHOTOGRAPHING SHOW WINDOWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is natural that all trimmers should be
interested in the proper reproduction of
their displays. The photograph is an imperishable
evidence of the trimmer’s skill
and genius. It counts more with employers
than any other one thing. If you wish a
position the merchant at once asks, “What
kind of work can you do?” Your photograph
answers the question. He cannot dispute
its evidence. Besides, photographs
taken at various times in your career afford
a record of your progress. You can see
how far you have advanced, and profit by
the comparison.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are a few points that it is well to
know and remember concerning the process
of photographing show windows:</p>

<p class='c007'>If there is a broad street before your window,
or an open space, it will be almost
impossible to take a picture by day; for,
plant your camera where you will, it is always
darker in your window than it is outside,
and the opposite condition should prevail.
But you can get it at night. See that
your electric lights, while flooding the window,
are themselves hidden from the street.
If you have a good lens from twenty to thirty
seconds’ exposure will be enough. A
lens not especially rapid will require more
time. The size of the diaphragm also
counts. The smaller the diaphragm, the
more time is required; but the small diaphragm
also gives an additional sharpness
to your picture. And then, people can walk
between the camera and the window without
injuring the picture—provided they
don’t stop short. The time required is also
influenced by the rapidity and make of the
plate. Therefore you have three things to
consider in timing your picture—lens, plate
and diaphragm.</p>

<p class='c007'>A good time to photograph a window is
early morning, on a clear day, just before
sunrise. The light is strong and penetrating,
and a good picture will usually result.
Remember that the interior of your window
must be light. If your window is darker
than the street the glass acts as a mirror,
reflecting everything on the opposite side of
the street. If the sun shines on your window,
and the opposite side of the street is
dark, there will be no reflections of foreign
objects in your picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>By keeping these important items of information
in mind any country photographer
can get a good picture of a show window.
If the photographer doesn’t know
them, it would be well to call his attention
to these facts. He may not have had experience
in “shooting” show windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>A method often adopted with good success
is as follows: Make a cloth screen of
black cambric, sufficiently large to shut off
all reflections when raised before the window.
Fasten the two upper corners to
poles, and when about to take the picture
have two men or boys raise the screen just
back of the camera. All reflections will be
avoided, and a clear picture result. As it is
not probable many photographers will prepare
such a screen, we advise trimmers to
have one made, and keep in readiness for
occasions when they want their windows
photographed. Flashlight pictures will not
avoid reflections.</p>

<p class='c007'>You must not attempt to use the screen
on windy days, however, for the wind will
render it unmanageable.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>A prominent decorator describes his experience
in photographing windows in the
following words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Under ordinary circumstances it is extremely
difficult to photograph a window
display, owing to reflections caused by dark
objects in the display. These, acting in a
similar manner to mercury on the back of a
mirror, make the plate glass a strong reflector
of objects outside the window. Frequently
a photograph contains not only the
window display, but trees, buildings, people,
and even the camera itself, often to the
total exclusion of important portions of the
trim. If the glass is extra thick the reflections
may be caused by a light colored display
as well. Having suffered many severe
disappointments in photographing my windows,
I have been driven to resort to almost
every known method in photography
to endeavor to eliminate this very objectionable
feature from my pictures. But I
always met with failure until I accidentally
noticed, while looking at a window one
evening, that while the windows across the
street were dark, and the arc lights opposite
were extinguished, there was absolutely
no reflection on the glass. This was, of
course, a very natural circumstance, but
one a person might easily overlook. As an
experiment I planted my camera before the
window, and made a flash light exposure of
the display, only to find that in the center
of the picture I had a great white blotch
caused by the flash—it being reflected by
the glass. Again I tried. The incandescent
lights are placed in a strip running along
the inside front of the window, just above
the sash, and fitted with cone-shaped reflectors,
which is the best system of window
illumination ever used, and one that is being
universally adopted. The display was
a millinery window, done chiefly in white.
I allowed an exposure before the camera of
twenty minutes under the light ordinarily
used in the window, and I got a beautiful
picture entirely free from reflection.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The length of exposure depends entirely
upon the nature of the goods displayed,
darker goods requiring a longer exposure.
An oriental rug display I give thirty minutes,
and a white window does not really
require more than fifteen minutes. Passing
street cars, all having their lights in about
the same place, will cause a streak in the
plate if the lens is not covered while they
go by. This can be easily done, without
danger of moving the camera, by simply
holding the cover of your plate holder before
the lens. The same thing may be done
when a person stops before the window.
You must make allowances for the time the
plate<a id='t145'></a> is thus covered, so that your total exposure
will be from fifteen to thirty minutes,
as your judgment dictates is the time required.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have found this method of photographing
at night, by the electric light of the window
itself, by far the most satisfactory of
any I have attempted, as the results are uniformly
good.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='c008'>WORDS OF ADVICE.</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>CARE OF WAX FIGURES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Now I wish to say just a few words regarding
the care of wax figures. I think
there is nothing that looks so bad, or ruins
the effect of the window so much, as to see
handsomely dressed wax figures with faded,
dirty or shiny faces; and too often we do
see this. With a very little practice and
time a trimmer can recolor his figures as
well as an expert can do it for him. First
take coal oil and a piece of cheesecloth and
wash the face; but do not allow the oil to
remain on the face more than a few moments,
as it will soften the wax. When
wiped dry and cleaned, take powdered pumice,
mixed with a very little carmine; mix
until all the red streaks have been thoroughly
worked in. This will give you a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>very light pink shade. Then get a large sable
brush, dip it in the preparation and commence
at the point of the cheek, using a
circular motion of the brush, and so continue
until the face has been covered. Give
the cheeks more time than the rest of the
face. It will give them more color. For
the lips, corners of the eyes and nostrils,
mix the carmine and pumice half and half,
and use a very small sable brush. With a
little care and practice any trimmer can recolor
his figures with slight trouble.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>JANUARY SALES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>During the month of January certain
lines of goods are pushed to the front and
“sales” inaugurated to induce customers to
purchase liberally. The holidays being over,
and the demand for fancy goods and notions
comparatively small, staples and necessary
articles are alone capable of interesting the
public.</p>

<p class='c007'>White goods, linens, cottons and muslin
underwear are in natural demand during the
month of January. Perhaps, were the choice
left to the housewife, she might prefer to
purchase these lines a little later in the season.
But when she notes the “special sales”
inaugurated by all prominent houses, she
wisely decides to take advantage of the opportunity
and lay in a stock of goods for
the coming months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Linen sales are always expected in January,
and when the holiday windows come
out the linen windows usually go in. In
smaller towns the sales do not commence
until about January 15, and are continued
for two or three weeks.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CLEARING SALES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>If ever a window trimmer is useful to his
house it is when “clearing up” sales are in
order and it is necessary to reduce stock before
inventory.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many goods left over from the
holiday stocks that should not be carried
another year, and the house prefers to make
a reduction in price in order to close them
out promptly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now is the trimmer’s opportunity to be
useful. He is given a lot of odds and ends,
at attractive prices, and told to “sell them.”
His cards should be carefully and vigorously
worded, his displays especially attractive.
For he isn’t catering now to a public
in search of goods to purchase, but a public
that must be coaxed and “jollied” into buying
what it really doesn’t need—and that,
too, at a time when pocketbooks are especially
shrunken and debilitated. Therefore
the man who makes a catchy trim is rendering
himself especially valuable to his employers,
and trimmers should use every endeavor
to make their trims count, and try
to do conscientious work.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BUSINESS WINDOW.</h3>

<p class='c010'>It has lately become the fashion to discourage
mechanical displays, as well as
“picture” windows and elaborate trims of
all sorts, under the plea that they are not
“business windows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me a plain, business window,” says
the merchant; and the trimmer does not argue
the question very fiercely, for it saves
him a lot of thought and a lot of hard work.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is a “business” window? What
is usually meant by the term is a window
that will sell goods—the final aim of all window
trimming. How can a window sell
goods? By placing them before the public
in such a manner that the observer has a
desire for them, and enters the store to
make the purchase. Once in, the customer
may see other things she wants, and no
matter how much she purchases under
these conditions the credit of the sale belongs
to the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, mark one point in this statement. I
said “observer.” All goods placed in a
show window are not observed. Since the
street is lined with windows, all filled with
merchandise, few people stop to notice any
of them unless there is something in the
window that especially catches the eye. A
“business window” that has no attractive
quality is not really a business window. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>is a fool window. The attractive window is
the business window. To make an attractive
window requires all the brain power and
craft and taste and handiwork of the most
expert trimmer. The inexpert trimmer is
the man who decorated that window which
is not attractive and which the passing
throng does not see at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to make a window stand out
from its fellows something more than a
plain arrangement of merchandise is needed.
It must be unusual and distinctive to
the extent of arresting the attention of busy
people as they hurry along the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shrewd and observant trimmers have
found that the secret of successful windows
is to have a background or mechanical
device that will command attention, and
then to place the goods in so ingenious a
manner that in looking at the display people
note the excellence of the goods and desire
to purchase them. It’s the old idea of
first catching your hare and then cooking it.
But you must catch your hare. You must
have an attraction that induces the pedestrian
to stop and look, or your window is a
flat failure. That is why beautiful, artistic
and mechanical displays are to be encouraged
rather than discouraged. These are
the real “business windows.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A HINT TO DEPARTMENT MANAGERS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>If you wish to get the best results from
the window and window trimmer, give him
a chance and lay out the goods you desire in
the window. Lay them all out, as nearly
as possible, then call the window trimmer
and let him look over them; tell him the
story; let him know all about them from
your point of view, when without doubt you
will find the window more to your idea than
otherwise. Do not take it for granted the
trimmer knows all you know about these
particular goods. No matter how much
experience he may have, tell him what you
desire. If you simply hand out a lot of
stuff, just about as it comes, it will appear
in the window in pretty much the same
shape. Do not forget that the trimmer’s
first thought is, How will they drape or set
best? How will the colors harmonize?
What kinds of stands or pictures can I get
or use? These and other considerations
are usually the way it strikes him; he does
not think of your point of view, or what
you want to say. Hence, as a matter of
course, the window tickets do not express
your idea at all, nor has the most been made
of the position of “leaders,” etc. The window
doesn’t draw as it should; there is but
little return; the buyer and every one else
concerned are out of temper, and feel like
finding fault with everybody but themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you have struck any particular arrangement
in which you desire to have your
window trimmed, say so. No doubt the
trimmer will have seen it, being always on
the lookout, and be happy to please.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should the goods be yard goods of various
colors, patterns and prices, then particularly
is it necessary for the trimmer to
see the major portion of the goods to go in,
that he may be able to make the best color
arrangement possible. Giving him two,
three or four pieces at a time as he goes
along quite precludes the possibility of any
kind of color harmony. The trimmer can
only set the four pieces, one after the other,
and then go for four more, to be set up in
like manner. This is the way not to do it.
Give all the goods at once—near as possible—so
he can select as he thinks best. That
is his particular business, has been his particular
study, and most likely he knows
more of color harmony than you do, and
can make a better window selection. The
same idea of course refers to all goods of
divers colors and patterns. This point is
important, as being conducive to good window
display, and profitable results therefrom.</p>

<p class='c007'>These little points may seem of but small
account to those of our buying confreres
who have not studied the matter. It is not
for me to tell them that every great business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>is made up of just such little things;
or in other words, to arrange every detail
so as to avoid loss of time (money), and to
get the best results (money) with the least
possible expenditure—system and discipline
count every time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every business man who has studied the
matter will recognize the fact that modern
and judicious window displays are of greater
drawing power than any other advertising
medium extant, and are becoming more
so every day, with enormous strides. Therefore
when you deal with a modern window
trimmer give him the courtesy due one who
has attained an indispensable position, by
long study, thought and diligence.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MONOGRAM CONSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Suggestions for making monograms for
window displays are shown in the accompanying
illustration. The letters may be
cut from thick pasteboard or from thin
wood, using a sharp knife for the purpose.
Often the letters are made several feet high,
and when covered with white cloth or
wound with decorative material make novel
and attractive exhibits. The monogram
can be supported in the center of a window
by means of cords from the ceiling or on a
wood rack.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_144.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>PROCESS FOR GILDING.</h3>

<p class='c010'>As the window trimmer is frequently required
to gild articles for display, the process
may be described. The material to be
gilded is first covered with a solution of gelatine
in hot water, to which an equal quantity
of alcohol is added, and the leaf gold
put on while wet. Then take a sheet of soft
paper and press and smooth it over the leaf
gold until the gelatine below is evenly distributed.
By this spots in the gilding are
prevented. Do not use too much gelatine,
as otherwise the gold becomes spotted; nor
too little, for in this case the binding is too
weak to enable the gold to withstand subsequent
polishing. The surfaces should be
cleaned before gilding. After having the
leaf gold put on, the whole is allowed to dry
for ten or twenty minutes, when the gold is
rubbed with cotton, whereby the luster is
produced. Then another layer of gelatine
is spread on with one stroke of a full, soft
and large brush, and if especially good work
be required, a second layer of leaf gold is
put on and covered with gelatine as before.
In this case, however, the gelatine is best
used hot. The same process can be employed
for silvering, but more gelatine
should be taken, as leaf silver is thicker than
leaf gold.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='c008'>HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Chiffon.</i>—The utility of chiffon in window
decoration is proved every day. The
material is so soft, fleecy and pliable that
it makes an admirable floor covering or
background, and is also adapted for shelves.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>An Illumination.</i>—Procure a number of
hanging fish globes, of about 4-quart size.
Cover them with colored tissue or crepe
paper, smooth on the surface, with a puffing
or shirr at the top. Suspend in various positions
in your window, and drop an incandescent
globe into each, or light with small
hand lamps. If the colors are harmonious
the illumination will be beautiful enough to
attract unusual attention to your display.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Prisms for Decorating.</i>—Suddenly a fad
has sprung up for decorating trims with
prisms, such as used on hanging lamps.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>They are sold by the hundred by any crockery
house, and are very reasonable in price.
To edge shelving in windows or for trimming
more profusely they are very bright
and pretty. In one recent trim 5,000 prisms
were used on the background, and when the
display was lighted at evening the bright
crystals looked like so many scintillating
diamonds.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Side Hoops.</i>—The sides of windows are
always more or less difficult to trim properly,
but by using small hoops, about twelve
or fifteen inches in diameter, nailed in various
positions against the side walls, you can
suspend within them many goods that will
show advantageously, and serve to balance
your trim. The hoops should be wound
with cheesecloth, thus making a frame for
the article you display.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Post Shelves.</i>—Posts in windows frequently
annoy and puzzle trimmers, who
find them awkward to contend with. Post
brackets are easily made, and are serviceable,
while they obviate the disadvantage of
the post. Make shelves fitting halfway
around the post and fronting the window
glass. Place them equal distances apart,
and then tack pleats of cheesecloth to the
edges, allowing the pleats to run down to
the next shelf, where they are bunched and
tacked. Make the shelves of such width
as will accommodate the goods you wish to
display.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Suspended Stands.</i>—Cut a square board
large enough for the form to stand upon,
cover it neatly, and suspend from the ceiling
by ribbons running from each corner.
One beauty about these is they do not interfere
with the trim below them.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Framed Forms.</i>—Secure a large gilt
frame, set it in the center of your window
and build behind it an alcove lined with
dark drapery. Set a form, costumed as desired,
in this alcove, and light with electric
lights placed inside the frame and out of
view. The effect is similar to that of a lifesized
picture, and is very attractive.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Umbrellas and Neckwear.</i>—Make stands
of threes of umbrellas, and lay neckwear
over the crossed handles. Or, fasten canes
or umbrellas to the sides and back of your
trim, the ferrules sticking into the bored
holes of a proper size to hold them firmly;
and over these improvised fixtures drape
four-in-hands, hosiery, etc. The crooked
handles may be used for suspending made
ties.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Ribbon Decoration.</i>—Where the trim
occupies only the floor of the window, the
display may be balanced by running broad
ribbons from the four corners, crossing in
the center and placed about midway between
the trim and the ceiling. Make a
large bow for each corner and one in the
center where the ribbons cross. This idea
may often be utilized in millinery trims.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Wash Day.</i>—For a wash goods window
put a form representing a laundress bending
over a wash tub and engaged in washing
a piece of goods of the class the window
is draped with. A sign should read, “Yes,
these will wash.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Easter Panorama.</i>—A panorama of Easter
flowers may easily be made by placing
bunches of various flowers on an endless
belt, which, when attached to a motor, carries
the flowers across the window in one
continual stream.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Live Canary Birds.</i>—Here is a novel suggestion
that will make a capital background
for any window: About three feet from
the back of your window put a screen of
illusion or some open material, the color being
cream or some light tint that will render
the netting as invisible as possible. In
the space behind the netting place some
wires at various distances, so that the birds
may perch upon them. A few canaries in
this backing, flying here and there, as they
will, will prove a great attraction. A painted
background of a summer scene will
greatly improve the effect.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Human Forms.</i>—The fad just now is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>use human forms to show goods. A handsomely
fitted room is shown in the window,
and a lady, dressed in style costume, sits
or walks about, showing off her gown to
advantage. At times she displays cards
reading, “This lace costs —— a yard,” or
“This dress goods is only —— a yard,” thus
calling attention practically to the goods.
The ladies criticise the make and “hang”
and appearance of the fabrics, and the men—well,
if the display figure is pretty the
men are also attracted. Bicycle suits for
ladies were recently shown in this manner
in Chicago, the display figure, or model, appearing
in a different dress every hour.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Kaleidoscope.</i>—An ingenious display
consists of two rapidly revolving electric
fans, throwing about with their strong air
currents particles of red, white and blue paper,
forming a scene of kaleidoscopic
beauty.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Shamrocks.</i>—Cut a large shamrock, say
two feet high, from thin boards or cardboard,
and cover the surface thickly with
the artificial green rose leaves sold by millinery
houses. The effect is very beautiful
and it may be used in the center of your
window on St. Patrick’s day.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>To Show Ribbons.</i>—A pretty effect is
created by pushing out the center of a bolt
of ribbon and extending the coils to as great
a length as the width of the bolt will admit.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Icicles.</i>—Icicles in summer have a cooling
tendency. To make a cool looking window,
take strings (hempen cord is best) and
dip them in a solution of glue. While wet
scatter cotton along them until they are
from a quarter to a half inch thick. Let them
dry. Dissolve gelatine, making a solution
about as thick as ordinary syrup. Dip your
cords into this solution and hang them up
again to dry. Result—icicles as long and
thick as you want them; guaranteed not
to melt in the sun. Suspend them from the
top of your windows. Fill in the spaces between
them, on the ceiling, with vines of
smilax, artificial flowers and green leaves.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_146.jpg' alt='STAGES IN ICICLE-MAKING.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>House of Linens.</i>—Build a light frame
of a small house of any design to suit your
fancy, and cover it with strawboard, except
the spaces for windows and doors. Over
the board arrange toweling for the roof,
folded napkins for the sides, with solid colored
handkerchiefs for the windows. Light
from within.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Shirt Waists.</i>—Very attractive displays
may be made with shirt waists, which will
soon be in season. Make pads of excelsior,
wrapped with thin, flexible paper, and of
a size to fill out the waists, and insert one
into the bosom of each waist shown. Smaller
pads for sleeves may be used to advantage.
Waists should be fitted with collars,
ties and cuffs.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Winter Scene.</i>—A good window for winter
may be made by cutting down an old
tree (or part of one) and placing it in the
center of your window. Run cotton over
the tops of the bare branches to represent
snow, and sprinkle it with flitters. Two or
three stuffed robins or sparrows may be
placed upon the branches, which will also
hold many articles of merchandise.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Twist Crepe Backgrounds.</i>—Trimmers
are using crepe paper for backgrounds with
good effect. One mode is to cut the crepe
paper into three-inch strips, paste together,
end to end, until long enough to reach the
height of the window. One end is tacked
flat to the floor, and the strip is slightly
twisted until the curls that are formed are
about as close as those in a corkscrew. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>strip is then drawn fairly taut and tacked to
the ceiling. A few inches away a strip of
contrasting color is fastened in the same
way, and, continuing, a straight or circular
backing is thus formed which is bright and
attractive. Sometimes the tops of the
twisted columns are centered, and in a few
instances the ends are gathered together at
the bottom and spread, fan-like, from that
point.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Handkerchief Racks.</i>—These racks consist
of ¼-inch rods fastened under the back
edge of the counter top, running perpendicularly
to a height of eighteen inches above
the counter, and then forward horizontally
eighteen inches. The front end is flattened
and pierced with a small hole in which to
stick the standard of a price ticket. The
bars are placed a foot apart, and run the
length of the counter. Handkerchiefs are
fastened to the horizontal section by means
of clasps or cord, and the effect produced
by the display is remarkable, a few dozen
handkerchiefs presenting the appearance of
a large stock. The bars are common iron,
made by any blacksmith, and gilded.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Use of Wall Paper.</i>—Occasionally one
tires of the continuous use of cheesecloth
for backgrounds, and for variety a window
lined with wall paper is effective. Care
must be exercised in selecting a small,
dainty pattern, and the entire window space—sides,
back, ceiling and floor—should be
covered with the same pattern, as well as
any stands used in the trim. Dark backgrounds,
with small white figures, are most
desirable.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Holly.</i>—Windows trimmed with sprigs of
holly, having the red berries peeping from
among the dark green leaves, inspire shoppers
with the thought that Christmas is not
far off, and thus stimulate trade.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>A Snow Storm.</i>—Cover the bottom of
your window with cotton batting (sides and
top may also be covered if you wish). Dust
well with powdered mica or white frosting.
Place several incandescent lights, wire
guarded, so that they are hidden from view
by the cotton. Some of the lights may have
red bulbs. Secrete several electric fans in
various parts of the window, and, lastly,
throw three or four pounds of goose-down
into the window and start up the fans. You
will not only have a regular snow storm, but
a blizzard, and any central figure will be
seen as having a fight with the elements.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Rainbow.</i>—A very pretty window is
where the background is a huge rainbow,
consisting of a broad arch the full width of
the window. This arch is covered with
tinted cheesecloth, one tint blending with
another, and all the hues of the rainbow being
used. The effect is exceedingly striking.
A show card in front reads: “Don’t
Chase Rainbows. We Have the Goods and
the Prices. Trade with Us.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>A Blanket Window.</i>—Make an arch, extending
across the window, covered with
rolled blankets. Under the arch build a
small hill of irregular shape, covered with
some green material. Place toy sheep in
different positions upon the hill. Use draped
blankets for background. Natural wool
may also be effectively used to trim with.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Autumn Leaves.</i>—Natural or artificial
leaves, in the exquisite autumnal colorings,
may be effectively employed in decorating
windows. They are seasonable and attractive,
and easily procured.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Outfit Displays.</i>—Where a merchant carries
all lines of goods, a capital idea is to
make a window of outfit displays. Lay over
a form an attractive piece of dress goods,
and upon or around this group articles of
ladies’ wear to match the shade of the cloth,
such as gloves, ribbons, neckwear, umbrella,
shoes and a trimmed hat. Half a dozen
such outfits, contrasting well in colors,
make a window very attractive to the fair
sex.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Fireplaces.</i>—The soft glow of a fireplace
in the center or at the side of a window
brightens any trim, and in cold weather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>looks very cozy to the shivering crowds
that pass by.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>A Good Idea.</i>—Silks and dress Goods
may be attractively draped over short poles
suspended from the ceiling of the window
by means of chains. The poles should be
about two feet in length. Bows of bright
ribbon fastened to the chains midway between
the pole and ceiling add to the charm
of the display.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Illusion.</i>—A very pretty window trim
may be made by stretching illusion, of the
quality that hats are lined with, across the
center of the window, and upon its surface
pinning fancy handkerchiefs, etc., in artistic,
flower shaped effects. If the illusion
is stretched tightly it will be almost invisible,
and the goods will seem to the observer
to be suspended in mid-air.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>Box Models.</i>—Much attention may be
attracted by making from cardboard a
model of some well known building in your
town, such as the court house, public library,
college or a church, following the
form of its architecture and painting it to
resemble the original structure. Cut out
the windows and cover the openings with
colored tissue paper. By putting a light
inside you get a very pretty effect and one
that will be appreciated by your townspeople.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>A Prismatic Display.</i>—Take two large
panes of common window glass, and set
them in a frame about six inches apart.
Have them perfectly clean, and then fill
the space between them with cracked ice
of clean and clear quality. Place the frame
in the window, and behind the exact center
of it hang an electric light or place a lamp
with a reflector. From the sidewalk the
cracked ice will show the most beautiful
prismatic effects, in all the colors of the
rainbow. In cold weather the ice will last
throughout a day easily, and perhaps for a
longer time.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>A Pretty Trim</i> recently shown consisted
of an open well, built up of rough stones
and covered with moss, with an old oaken
bucket attached to a pole, which a boy is
just raising from the well. Autumn
leaves strew the ground, and at the back
of the scene is a fence consisting of two
rough rails and pickets of umbrellas and
canes alternating. A cabin built of underwear
is at one side, and a forest scene fills
in the back.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c007'><i>An Easter Bouquet.</i>—An appropriate
centerpiece for an Easter window is a large
bouquet of artificial flowers, among which
are scattered handkerchiefs, ties, gloves or
other small articles, which project from the
bouquet and bear neat price cards. Bouquets
may also be made in which handkerchiefs
are folded to represent Calla lilies.
Use a jeweled hat pin for the center of the
lily, and green cloth for a stem.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>A Waterfall.</i>—One of the department
stores in Minneapolis, wishing to call attention
to a ribbon sale, had an attractive window
display constructed as follows: It consisted
of a painted representation of Minnehaha
Falls. In place of a picture of the water
fall itself, many continuous bands of various
colors of ribbons passed from top to
bottom, being rapidly revolved by rollers,
one above and one below, turned by electric
motive power.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI.<br> <span class='c008'>THE STREET FAIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The street fair is the most popular form
of modern local enterprise, and has been
growing in popularity for several years.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>WHAT IT IS.</h3>

<p>STREET FAIR BOOTH.—<i>Brooks.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>The street fair consists of a series of
temporary booths erected on both sides
of the main street of a town, or around a
central square or park, if the town is
laid out that way. These booths are built
at the outer edge of the sidewalk, upon the
roadway, leaving the passageway of the
sidewalk at one side and the middle of the
street at the other side. Most booths face
the street, although often they are arranged
to face both the street and the sidewalk.
Each merchant builds his booth before his
own store, making a display of merchandise
in the booth, but selling goods only from
his regular stock. Confectionery, notions,
etc., are also sold from booths. At the
street corners or interspersed among the
booths of the merchants, are raised platforms
on which free entertainments, such
as juggling, acrobatic acts, legerdemain,
etc., are given at stated intervals for the
amusement of the people. In connection
with the street fair, various special attractions
are arranged, a balloon ascension one
day, a parade of floats on another, and so
on, according to the fancy or enterprise of
the committee.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>THE OBJECT.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The free street fair is intended not only
to attract temporary crowds to a town,
but to make the town popular to the farming
and outlying community tributary to it.
Many farmers live within reach of two or,
perhaps, three towns; but the enterprising
town—the one that entertains the farmers
with free street fairs, is supposed to be
thereafter favored with the largest share of
trade.</p>

<p>STREET FAIR BOOTH.—<i>Siemon.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Moreover, the street fair gives merchants
an excellent opportunity to make
the acquaintance of the neighboring farmers
and residents of smaller, near by towns.
This acquaintance ripens into a friendship
and mutual respect that not only wins
trade, but holds it for all time.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SUCCESS OF STREET FAIRS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>How successful the scheme of free
street fairs has been is evinced by the fact
that towns which have once held this sort
of entertainment are always eager to continue
them the next year, and the next—and
are still holding street fairs. Seldom
has the committee been called upon to collect
a dollar of the original subscription—for
the fairs pay their own way, and only
cost each merchant the expense of his individual
display. It is stated that no street
fair has ever been a failure since the idea
was first conceived, although of course the
measure of their success depends greatly
upon the ability of the committee and the
enterprise of the merchants in making attractive
displays.</p>

<p>STREET FAIR BOOTH.—<i>Walthes.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The street fair has proved itself much
superior to the old style county or state
fair. The people are held day and night at
the door of the merchants instead of spending
their time two or three miles away from
town. The old-style fair leaves a town deserted,
dull and forlorn. Trade is at a
standstill, and merchants agree it is almost
as well to close their doors during fair
week. The street fair is a period of excitement,
hustling and constant sales for every
merchant. The people are forced to remain
where there is a constant temptation
to spend their spare cash—and of course
they spend it.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c009'>TIME TO HOLD STREET FAIRS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The season of street fairs is from May
to October, although some are being held
in this month of April in the warmer states.
They usually open on Tuesday morning
and end Friday night, although in some
cases the entire week, including Monday
and Saturday, is not considered too long
a period for the festivities.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>HOW TO ORGANIZE A STREET FAIR.</h3>

<p class='c010'>First you must have a guaranteed fund.
This is procured as follows: (a) Subscriptions
from merchants; (b) sale of booths
and privileges; (c) sale of advertising space
on the daily souvenir programme.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost of a street fair is from $2,500
upward, depending on size of your town,
the amount of advertising you do, etc.</p>

<p>STREET FAIR BOOTH.—<i>Hastings.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>You will need a large number of committees
to properly handle your street fair.
One object of having a great many committees
is to give every business man in
town something to do in connection with
the fair, so that those who are inclined to
grow lukewarm will, of necessity, be compelled
to take continued interest in the
forthcoming fair. Furthermore, there are
too many details connected with the work
of preparing for the fair and conducting it,
to be placed on the shoulders of one small
committee. Accordingly, there must be
separate committees for each department
of street fair work. The finance committee
must look after raising the money. The
amusement committee must see that proper
attractions and amusements are provided.
The committee on premiums will get up the
premium list, appoint judges in the various
departments and see that the awarded
premiums are paid. The committee on
parades and special days will look after the
work indicated by its title. You will need
also a committee on contests, such as cake
walking, baby shows, old violin players, fat
men’s race, greased pole climbing, greased
pig catching and such other diversions as
may be introduced for local talent in addition
to the attractions engaged from
abroad. Your committee on privileges and
booths will be able to render great service
to the association by using proper judgment
and enterprise. A large revenue can
be realized from the sale of booths and
spaces for merry-go-rounds, Ferris wheels,
side shows, etc. Your committee on railroads
will have to look after the important
work of securing special reduced rates from
all points in territory tributary to your city
during the continuance of the fair. By appointing
influential men on this committee
and having them go direct to the main
offices of the railroad company you will be
able to secure liberal concessions in the way
of reduced excursion rates that will greatly
swell your attendance during the week.
Your committee on advertising will have
plenty of work to do. It is a good plan to
appoint the local newspaper men on this
committee. They will keep booming the
street fair from the time that the date is
fixed upon, and will see that the field is
thoroughly and constantly covered, so far
as the advertising is concerned. You will
also need an executive committee. This
committee may include all the members of
the above committees, these being only
sub-committees of the executive committee,
or it may be limited, as you think best.
In some cities a regular street fair company
is incorporated under the laws of the
state, with a president, board of directors,
etc. This is a very good plan. It gives an
air of permanence to the organization and
makes all the transactions of the association
more business-like in character.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>AMUSEMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Good attractions must be secured for
the free entertainments. Do not make the
mistake of hiring cheap performers, as they
will disgust your people rather than entertain
them. There are now a number of expert
conductors, or general managers of
street fairs, who hire their services to committees
and advise the townsmen in all details.
These men, having had ample experience,
are very useful to committees and
often insure the success of the fair. When
there is no resident of your town available
who has a genius for carrying out such enterprises,
the employment of an expert director
is advised. In this case it is better
to secure your man in the beginning, as he
can then assist in organizing the entire festival.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PROMINENT DETAILS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>R. J. McDonald, who is an authority on
street fairs, gives the following excellent
advice as to details:</p>

<p>GENERAL VIEW OF THE STAUNTON, VA., STREET FAIR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>The first step is to interest the city authorities,
the manufacturing dealers of all
lines, and the citizens in general. Then, in
order, follow the securing of the necessary
subscriptions, concessions from all lines of
transportation and many other sources, advertising,
newspaper work, billing the
country for at least 200 miles in all directions,
daily souvenir programme, the formation
of the different committees, arranging
street parades daily, securing the use
of vacant grounds for the erection of booths
for the merchants and manufacturing displays,
for a Midway inclosure, space for
lease to venders of all kinds. Then comes
the famous Midway, which, without doubt,
will be the most attractive feature of the
street fair. Who can forget Chicago in
1893, and the people of all nations? For
this feature some large traveling street fair
combination should be secured—one which
will have all the features which go to make
up a successful Midway.</p>

<p class='c007'>You would also need tents for the press
and visitors, one large tent for dining hall—would
advise that this be in charge of,
and under the management of some congregation—German
and Irish villages,
with the native dance and the Irish piper
to warm the hearts of their countrymen,
also two or three free exhibitions, which
should be the best in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, to make the fair a success, the
writer would advise making concessions to
some charitable institution or some good
cause; then you get the ladies, clergy and
press with you, and if you can do this, it
is sure to be a grand success. The fair
must be advertised largely, like a circus,
special rates on all lines of transportation.
Every day must be a special day. A different
parade, finishing at the entrance to the
fair, should be held every afternoon—never
in the morning. There should be a military
day for the entertainment of the soldiers of
the civil war, both union and confederate,
the soldiers of the Spanish-Philippine war,
also a school children’s day. This being
campaign year, would advise a democratic
and republican day, and invite some of the
most prominent speakers of the country,
candidates for office, etc. I would also advise
a public marriage on one of the days,
and each afternoon or evening a genuine
old-fashioned cake walk, combined with
fireworks and an abundance of good music.
A floral parade, properly handled, with a
popular lady citizen as queen, would be the
strongest feature of the week, and would
draw thousands of strangers to any city.
This part of the entertainment will require
some one with experience to handle, if it
is to be a success.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FLOATS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>During street fairs, as well as the ordinary
country fairs, industrial parades are
frequent, and often the decorator is puzzled
how to construct an effective float.</p>

<p class='c007'>We show several pictures of floats in
the late Milwaukee industrial parade. The
booth was built upon a large wagon truck
and had a latticed roof. The lower sides
of the booth hung over the wheels and were
elaborately pleated and puffed. Fancy groceries
were shown in the float, and maidens,
dressed to represent the southern climes
from whence the goods came, were seated
on each of the sides.</p>

<p>PARADE FLOAT—“THE SEASONS.”—<i>Goldsman.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Eight horses, caparisoned in white, with
large plumes on their heads, were attached
to the float, and each horse was led by a
groom in fancy dress. This float was one
of the most successful in the parade.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most novel floats ever constructed
was that of Mr. Mahana, shown
herewith. It was shaped like a large slipper,
and completely covered the wagon
truck on which it was placed. Silver foil
covered the entire surface, and around the
edge, or sole, was an ornamental border in
white and gold. Underneath the big umbrella
sat a bevy of pretty girls.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_164.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In our first picture is shown a clothing
float, the star and crescent being adopted
as the design. Although somewhat crudely
carried out, the idea is a good one.
While only one coat was shown on each
side of the star, the float attracted much attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mercantile Co.’s float, was part of a
floral parade. Float and horses were decorated
in pure white, and five young girls,
seated under the canopy, wore flowing
white draperies. The relief to this was
given by the mass of greenery in the interior
of the float, and by the signs, which
were lettered in emerald green.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE SEASONS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>This float showed on the four sides the
allegorical presentations of Spring, Summer,
Autumn and Winter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. 1.—Spring.—Front Section of
Float.—Arbor and arch trimmed with artificial
marguerites and morning glories, intertwined
with foliage. Glass prisms hang
suspended to represent dew drops.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Spring,’ draped in pure white gauze;
wings at shoulders. Butterflies and aigrette
in the hair. She is represented seated on
a large mushroom (made of a 24-inch
chopping bowl). Before her are seated
four large rabbits on their hind legs. On
the spreading limb of the tree that fronts
her are perched two big crows, a blue jay,
an oriole and two small birds, all posed in
the act of singing (beaks high and open).
Spring is clasping in one hand a baton and
in the other a piece of music. She is giving
the birds and rabbits their first spring
lesson. This section was called ‘An Ode to
Spring.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. 2.—Summer.—Right Side Section
of float.—‘Summer,’ draped in light blue
cheesecloth and silver tinsel. On head a
wreath of pink and white roses, and on one
shoulder butterflies, on the other roses.
In her left hand she carries basket of roses.
Arbor and archway are trimmed entirely
with pink and white roses, three gross being
used (artificial). Plums and peaches
hang pendent from the top. At her feet
(on the right) crouches a large white swan.
At each corner of this section are two full
size cranes, three feet high.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. 3.—Autumn.—Left Side of Float,
Ceres (Wheat).—‘Autumn’ is represented
by a brunette draped in corn-colored
cheesecloth. Her long wreath is of corn
flowers, poppies and wheat. On her head
a wreath of poppies and wheat. In her
right hand she carries a sickle. Under her
left arm she carries a loosely bound sheaf
of wheat. Arbor and archway trimmed
with poppies and wheat. A dozen bunches
of artificial, full size grapes hang from top
of the arbor. In the growing wheat, at
each side of this section, are two quail and
two hares.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“No. 4.—Winter.—Rear of Float.—Represented
by a young lady draped in
dark green. In one hand she carries a bow,
in her belt she has an arrow. Her wreath
for the hair is of holly berries and ivy.
Her bower and arch are trimmed with ivy
and dahlias. Her corsage wreath is of
dahlias. At her left crouches a Texan
puma, life size; at her right stands a full
sized deer.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CLEOPATRA’S BARGE.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The combination was green and pink.
The figurehead was relief papier mache
work done in gold on bronze green ground.
The large leaf (sail) is also papier mache
work. Close scrutiny is necessary to see
the best work.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>PATRIOTIC FLOAT.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The framework is light, but substantial,
the canopy being supported by iron bars
on which sleeve puffing is used. These
bars are turned at top and bottom, flattened,
and furnished with screw holes. The
umbrella holders at the corners are made
in the same way, four handsome girls standing
beneath the umbrellas. Quite a few

<h3 class='c009'>ORIGINAL STREET FAIR BOOTH WITH REVOLVING ILLUMINATED BALL.</h3>

<p class='c010'>It has always been my theory—and I
have yet to hear it successfully disputed—that
it is better to have an attractive advertisement
costing $1 than a poor one costing
twenty-five cents; and on this hypothesis
the above booth will be described. The
street fair is one of the best chances for advertising
you will ever get. Your audience
is not going to be the same that critically
and leisurely inspected your show
windows and the goods and taste displayed
therein the week before. It is going
to be a rushing, pushing, good natured and
sight seeing crowd. It will not be one
that will be critically inclined, nor have time
for minute details. Knowing this to be a
fact, it is “up to you” to get in your advertising
and do it with a booth that will arrest
the eye, whether in a hurry or not.
Here is where you can use all the loud,
flashy and contrasting colors you want.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>First you must see if your electric light
company has the “strings” of lights (see
Fig. 1), shown running from the center to
corners, on hand. There are companies
who keep these on hand, with weatherproof
sockets, to be rented out for just such purposes.
The lights shown around the edges
can be put in by any electrician at a small
cost on one circuit. Both these and the
“strings” are supposed to burn steadily, and
not connected to the flasher. The carpenter
contractor will undoubtedly put in an
appearance in due time. These contractors
usually put up the booths for a stipulated
price, rent you the lumber and remove it
when the fair is over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next is the ball frame (see Fig. 2). This
is intended to be six feet in diameter, made
of strips of wood or moulding ¼ × 3 inches,
soaked in hot water and bent to form. The
3-inch width is to give you a base for the
lamp sockets. Between the six ribs shown
run hogshead hoops to give fullness between
the ribs shown. The frame can be
covered with two contrasting colors in six
equal sized pieces for daylight effect, and
the colored lights will take care of this part
in the evening. The shaft should be of 1-inch
gas pipe. Having had a platform
built inside the booth flush with the gables,
it will be a length equal from the floor of
the platform to the peak of the roof, plus
the height of the ball and six inches for
clearance. Have the bottom drawn to a
point or filled with a pointed plug shown
at C (Fig. 2), and provide a socket bearing.
This bearing is intended to support
the entire ball and not offer undue friction
to its rotation. It will also be necessary
to provide an extra shield near the bottom
to prevent a heavy wind forcing it out of
the socket sideways. At a point just under
the peak of the roof, which is also the upper
bearing for the shaft, drill two ½-inch
holes. Drill two holes also at a point between
the roof outside and the bottom of
the ball, shown at A. The contact rings
and brushes at B are fully described in detail
in the March issue of The Show Window.
These will be made the same, only
larger. Equip the shaft with a 5-inch
grooved pulley belt direct to the countershaft
of your flasher, and it will run about
thirty revolutions per minute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shield shown in Fig. 3 is made of
tin or painted pasteboard, and will be
found absolutely necessary to keep rain out
of all sockets pointing outward from a
point above the center of the ball. If water
was to get in between the socket and lamp
base, plugs will be blown faster than you
can put them in.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_171b.jpg' alt='Fig. 4. Fig. 5.' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The wiring is shown in Fig. 4. There
are three circuits, each of different color,
divided into two parts, each half on opposite
sides of ball. One side of each row
of lights will be coupled to a common main,
which will go inside the shaft at the upper
hole and out again at the lower; thence to
the bottom ring, which is connected to the
main direct. Circuit No. 1, red, goes from
the first brush on the flasher to top ring
and brush on the shaft and thence to the
remaining sides of the two red rows. Circuit
No. 2, white, goes from No. 2 on flasher
to No. 2 brush and ring, thence connects
to remaining sides of the two white
rows. Circuit No. 3, green, goes from No.
3 on flasher to No. 3 ring and brush, thence
to the remaining sides of the two green
rows. The other main goes to the leg of
flasher direct. Run one wire from each
main for the motor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Set your flasher lugs as shown in Fig.
5, and the various color changes will take
place, as shown at the side of diagram in
the order given.</p>

<p class='c007'>After you are through with your wiring,
you will probably find your hands not in
condition to hold the dainty hand of Angelina,
and which soap fails to remove. Don’t
get scared. This will probably be a combination
of muriatic acid, asphaltum and
rubber. They can be cleaned as follows:
Wash first in water, without soap, to remove
the acid. Next loosen the asphaltum
with any kind of oil or grease. Lastly,
wash them with soap, water and sawdust,
and you will be surprised to see how easily
it is done when you know how.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='c008'>DISPLAYS FOR EASTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Easter is especially the season for artistic
decoration, and no American holiday, save
Christmas, receives so much attention in
decoration from our merchants. It comes
after a season of comparative dullness, and
as it is a time of joy and brightness, of full
purses and generous hearts, extraordinary
efforts are made to delight the public with
gorgeous and pretty displays, and to tempt
the good folks to purchase liberally all those
knick-knacks and articles of apparel of
which orthodox church members have denied
themselves during the penitential days
of lent.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the campaign is well managed, Easter
should be a bounteous harvest to every
merchant. Think of all the bonnets, gloves,
laces, shoes, ribbons, silks, satins and furbelows
the ladies will require to “look sweet”
during the Easter sermon; all the hats, neckwear,
handkerchiefs, shoes, striped trousers,
walking sticks and spring overcoats the
gentlemen must have to fit themselves as
escorts for the charming sex; all the rich
foodstuffs that will be eaten off pretty linen
and dishes during the Easter dinner; all the
floral offerings and boutonnieres that will
spend their fragrance to droop and wither
in a day!</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one will sell all these things for
Easter.</p>

<p class='c007'>What will your share be?</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer depends much on the value
of your window display as an attraction and
salesman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course you wish to do your best. You
are in business to sell goods—to take advantage
of just such warm occasions as
Easter.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE EASTER LILY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Easter is the season of flowers. All flowers
are allowable. White are preferable.
But don’t use white flowers exclusively, for
they will give a funereal air to the entire
display. Use lilies, both calla and Easter
lilies, and with them mingle roses, tulips
and hyacinths, taking care to employ plenty
of greenery, vines and leaves.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_175.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The lily is an emblem of Easter. Make
your Easter lilies of mammoth proportions
for centerpieces or corner pieces. This may
be done by forming them out of cardboard,
which may be covered with white surah silk,
cheesecloth or white tissue paper. A good
sized lily of this variety may be made by
cutting sugar barrel hoops into quarter
sections, as seen in the diagram, and fastening
six pieces firmly together at one end.
Then cut six petals from heavy cardboard
and fasten to each hoop, on the outside. A
similar piece is placed inside, and the edges
glued or sewed together. The bit of hoop
is then hidden, but forms a rib to hold the
leaf in place. Place some puffed tissue in
the center, if the center shows, and wind
the lower end with cloth, after attaching the
stem. Sometimes a doll is seen peeping
from inside the mammoth lily; sometimes a
nest of eggs or a brood of chicks is placed in
the center. This depends upon the character
of your theme.</p>

<p>“THE EASTER ANTHEM.”—<i>Butement.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>If the lily alone is shown stamens must
protrude from the center of the leaves, and
these are made by covering insulating wires
with chrome yellow silk and placing a small
yellow ball at the end of each stamen.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE CALLA LILY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The calla is a beautiful lily, and is used
profusely for Easter decorations. It is quite
easily made in any desired size by following
the method shown in the diagram. Take an
oblong sheet of cardboard, indicated by the
dotted lines (Fig. 1), and bend it over (Fig.
2) to form a sort of cornucopia with a projecting
corner. Fasten the curled edges
with glue or brass paper fasteners, and then
form the projecting corner into an imitation
of the curled end of the leaf in a natural
lily. This may be quickly done by rolling it
with your fingers. A single yellow stamen,
rather thick, must project from the center,
rising a little above the edges of the leaf.
Now fasten on your stem, and the lily is
complete. Large sizes should be covered
with cloth. In small, natural sized lilies the
white cardboard is a good representation of
the leaf. Good effects are obtained by
planting these artificial lilies in flower pots
and placing these also in jardinieres. They
appear more natural when shown in this
way, but then leaves must be made to complete
the plant.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_177.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>FLORAL EMBLEMS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The cross is the principal emblem of
Easter, and is used in connection with many
displays, being suitable for any line of merchandise.
To be most effective it should be
a floral cross, and may be formed from natural
or artificial flowers. However, natural
flowers are so scarce in most towns, and
artificial flowers so inexpensive, that we
need consider only the latter. Of these, violets
are easily procurable, and are pretty
and appropriate. Festoons, or bunches of
them, always brighten a display. Such set
pieces as the cross, crown, star, the “gates
ajar” may be covered with masses of mixed
flowers, in which the tint of the violet predominates,
and the purity of the Easter or
calla lily affords a soothing relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wire netting, supported by a light framework
of thin lumber, is the ground for all
these floral emblems. The mesh should be
much smaller than it is drawn in the accompanying
design, for there is only need of
space to push the stem through. Begin at
one end, thrust a flower through the netting
so that it covers the edge, and wind a thread
around the stem from the back of the netting.
When the next flower is placed in
position and the thread given a turn around
it, both flowers are firmly fastened. One
thread unwound from the spool as needed,
will fasten the entire design securely. Floral
emblems made in this way are remarkably
light in weight, and may be suspended in
the window or placed in any desired position.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>EASTER EGGS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Easter would not be Easter without eggs,
and therefore eggs will be used in many
window designs. Mammoth eggs may be
constructed and decorated in a hundred different
ways. The mechanical egg, which
opens into two or four parts, is old but always
attractive. A clever idea is to build
several large eggs, over light wood or wire
framework, break in the front sides and
show a recess in each egg in which is a
“nest” of the goods you wish to call attention
to. White paper cambric—the shiny
side out—is the best representation of an
egg shell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cut small price cards the shape of eggs,
and place them in your Easter display; or
use real eggs, with the prices neatly painted
upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another idea is to blow out the insides of
a number of eggs, run a thread through
them and suspend them in your window at
different heights. Or, cover your window
floor with hay, to represent a hay mow, and
put nests of decorated or dyed eggs here
and there. Or, make a mammoth egg of
papier mache (or a framework), covered
with cloth, and use it for the center of your
window. This may be made to open by
dividing it into sections which are hinged
a short distance from the bottom, and connecting
each section with a string running
to a main cord. A boy can operate it from
back of the window, or it may be connected
with a motor. Put a prettily dressed baby
doll, or a chicken, in the center of the egg.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>RABBITS AND CHICKS.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_181b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A simple way to make these, in any desired
size, is to cut from heavy cardboard
or thin lumber the outline of the rabbit or
chicken. Then cut cloth, to extend one-fifth
beyond the edge of the outline (see
dotted lines), leaving more margin where
the body is thickest. Glue or tack the edges,
and stuff with cotton or excelsior, as shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>in the end section. Paint in eyes, etc., and
color with water colors.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE MECHANICAL LILY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>To render an Easter lily mechanical, so
that the petals will open and close, a small
circle of wood is securely fastened to the
standard rising from the floor. Each leaf
(there should be six) is then hinged to this
circular piece, a few inches from the lower
end of the leaf. At the extreme lower point
of each leaf is now fastened a cord, and all
the cords are gathered into one a short distance
down. Run the main cord through
the floor of your window and attach it to
the pivot of your water wheel. As the cord
is drawn downward the leaves all close;
when it is released the leaves open by their
own weight. In the center of the lily may
be placed any design or arrangement of
goods. Sometimes the figure of a doll clinging
to a cross is used.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>EASTER DESIGNS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The reader will find here a collection of
beautiful designs for Easter displays, all being
photographed from life. These will all
be useful in conveying ideas for the arrangement
of your own displays. It should
be borne in mind that no window display
can be accurately reproduced; yet often you
will find a way to improve upon the suggestion
offered you.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br> <span class='c008'>MEMORIAL DAY DISPLAYS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>A pretty custom it is to set apart one day
in memory of our nation’s fallen heroes,
and May 30 is always held in loving, if sad,
remembrance by our people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much advice has been offered in past
years concerning the appropriate decorations
for this day. Some favor depicting
the joy and triumph resulting from our
wars, and the glory of a life given for the
nation’s defense. Others see the sadness of
mourning friends only, and think the flower
strewn grave the best recognition of the
day. So the matter of design must be left
to the taste and disposition of the decorator.
It is well, however, to bear in mind that
mixed with the sorrow of the people is a
strain of pride and exaltation that their
loved ones died so nobly and heroically.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flowers in profusion should be used, and
the national colors are not inappropriate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since our late wars there are more soldiers’
and sailors’ graves to decorate than
ever before, and a new interest in Memorial
day has been aroused. Therefore the wise
merchant, who persistently caters to the
moods and whims of the great public, will
see that his show windows pay a fitting tribute
to the occasion.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A FLORAL FLAG.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A national flag composed of flowers is
made by running wires across a frame for
stripes and pinning red and white flowers
to them. Wire netting does nicely for this
purpose, and if natural flowers are not
available, red, white and blue artificial flowers
may readily be procured.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>RIBBON FLAGS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Another way to make a flag is to use ribbon
for the stripes and puffed blue silk with
white knots of baby ribbon for the stars. I
have seen some handsome flags made entirely
of baby ribbons. You can make red,
white and blue backgrounds by using these
colors of Velvelette, which is easily applied.
Velvelette is a “flock” which comes in various
colors and can be had at paint stores.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>ILLUSTRATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The illustrations accompanying this chapter
are appropriate designs for Memorial
Day. By studying them you will get ideas
for your own display, the details being readily
carried out through the instructions furnished
in the opening chapters of this book.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>FOURTH OF JULY DISPLAY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Trimmers will find no difficulty in securing
appropriate subjects for Independence
Day, as our recent history abounds in striking
incidents. But it must not be forgotten
that July 4 is dedicated to the heroes of the
revolution and to the signers of the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many people, I know, place an electric
fan where its powerful breeze moves the
flag in quick waves; but after all, that is not
a natural method of waving “Old Glory.”
The sweep of the flag pole itself in a semi-circle
is the proper method of waving the
star spangled banner, and this effect may
easily be procured in a show window.</p>

the war as they may occur. The section of
frame marked “white” is beveled, or placed
on an incline, to better carry out the effect
of a picture frame. Above your picture three
flags are naturally and continually waved,
and the effect is well worth the slight
trouble required to produce it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second illustration, which is the rear
plan, explains the waving of the flags. Three
circular slots (3) are cut in the frame,
through which the flag staffs (2) are placed.
These are weighted at the ends (7) to make
them balance. Place the pulleys (4) as
shown in the cut, and run a cord over the
pulleys connecting with the flags. Opposite
each connection place a rubber cord or
weak spring, fastened to the framework in
such a position that as the cord slacks it
will pull the flag to the opposite side. The
pin and block (5) for the flag to work on
should be loose enough for free motion.
The wheel (6) gives the motion to the cord,
and is operated by a small motor. The apparatus
is very easily constructed, and
works perfectly. In front of the picture
place stacks of arms and a cannon, to fill
in the foreground. The cannon is made as

carpet paper and apply black or yellow cloth
or paint, to make it resemble iron or brass.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THANKSGIVING DISPLAYS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>While much labor, time and expense is
devoted to Christmas windows the trimmer
often neglects his Thanksgiving displays.
For this reason hardly anything strictly new
is ever seen on this occasion. As a matter
of fact, it is much easier to scheme for
Christmas than for Thanksgiving displays,
as the trimmer has a greater variety of attractive
material for his work at his disposal
and more liberal allowances are made
on his employer’s side for the occasion. Yet
we can without any great expenditure produce
many attractive and new Thanksgiving
displays. Winter scenes of different
character can easily, quickly and economically
be gotten up and are very adaptable.
On Thanksgiving Day we have usually
snowy, wintry weather; should it happen,
however, that this year this is not the case,
do not let the weather interfere with your
work. Thanksgiving Day being the opening
day of the season a winter scene is always
appropriate, very effective and makes
a winning, pleasing impression upon the
passerby.</p>

<p>THANKSGIVING DISPLAY.—<i>Green.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If your window is large enough you may
construct a pretty background by building
mountains, partly covered with snow. Take
old dry goods boxes of various sizes and
pile them up in an irregular fashion so as
to form the shape of mountains. A few
boards and strips will also be required to
obtain the desired effect. Cover this frame
with carpet paper, that the hills, rocks and
earth will be properly represented. Take
care to hide the edges of the paper. Heavy
old packing canvas may be used instead of
paper, if you have it. Cover the paper or
canvas with cheap water color, consisting of
black and white mixed with a little umber
brown, to give it the proper color. You
do not need to be much of an artist to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>this work. After it is painted cover the
tops of the hills, the gullies and the floor
with cotton, in such manner as to imitate
snow. Place the display in the back and
sides of the window, so as to leave floor
space in front. From the upper parts of the
mountains have a little brook or rill run
down till it reaches a pond of water at the
bottom. The pond is made by placing on
the floor a flat wash tub, having a hole in
the bottom connected with a waste pipe.
The outside of the tub, up to the edge, must
be hidden with rocks and snow, and the inside
should be painted a brownish green.
Put a few pebbles in it to cover the bottom.
The brook can be arranged by using a runway
of tin, painted brown, which must be
bent into an irregular course, and follow
the shape of the mountains. One or two
pretty cascades may be made by allowing
the water to fall a few inches from one
trough to another. Place small stones and
snow at the edges to give it a natural effect.
The water may be supplied from a barrel set
up in the back of the window, or by a connection
with water works. A few dry
branches placed here and there will represent
trees. A red incandescent light behind
the top of the highest mountain will give a
very pretty effect to the scene, as it will
look like the sun setting or a volcanic
mountain. The cotton, or snow, will almost
appear as on fire. To complete the picture
scatter some diamond dust over the cotton
to make it sparkle like snow. Some rabbits
in the foreground, a form dressed as a hunter,
etc., are additions which will suggest
themselves to a trimmer able to procure
them. Put a few goods at the front of
the window and don’t forget the price cards.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_193a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For a thanksgiving scene paint a background
on cloth, showing a farm, with barn,
rail-fence, trees, etc., in the distance. From
this background a block of turkeys is seen
marching forward like a file of soldiers. All
this is painted. The real scene now begins.
Show the corner of a house at one side, and
a farmer’s form with axe in hand, beside a
stump. Two or three dead turkeys (real
ones) are lying near, their heads severed
from their bodies. Red paint upon the axe
and stump will show the slaughter is real.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first turkey on the painted scene
could bear a placard reading, “We are ready
for you,” or “A Sacrifice of the Innocents,”
or something similar.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_193b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Be sure the bottom edge of the scene is
covered by cotton, branches, or stones, so
that the painted scene will blend into the
real one.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE TURKEY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The Turkey being the natural emblem of
Thanksgiving Day we show a most beautiful
bird of this species created from linens.
We print herewith a cut of the framework,
showing how to construct the foundation.
The tail is made separate from the body and
fastened on with screw hooks, so that it
may be handled easily; 194 doilies were
used in the covering. A good idea would
be to place a sign on the turkey reading:
“Good to eat off.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>CHRISTMAS DISPLAYS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>It has been estimated that the value of
the merchandise disposed of during December
is equal to that sold during the other
eleven months of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is no wonder, then, that active preparations
have been made for months in advance
to take care of the holiday trade to
the best advantage.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE MERCHANT’S DUTY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>is to provide for his window display on an
elaborate scale. No notion of false economy
should be allowed to interfere with the
attractiveness of his displays. He must remember
that his trimmer has the brains and
skill to create beautiful effects, but is powerless
without the material to work with.</p>

<p class='c007'>To be economical—let us speak plainly,
and say stingy—in supplying your decorator
with material will lose you more trade
than you can afford to spare. If your competitor’s
display is better than yours the reason
will probably be that he has been more
liberal than you in providing proper material
for display. You can’t afford to allow
any one to outdo you in window display in
these days preceding the holidays, when
most of the shoppers depend upon the windows
to guide them in purchasing.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>THE TRIMMER’S DUTY</h3>

<p class='c013'>during this important season is to exercise
his talents to his employer’s best advantage.
He has doubtless been planning original
displays for months in advance, and if his
house affords him proper scope and material
he should strive to outdo all former
efforts to win trade for the firm that pays
him his salary in dull months, as well as
busy ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Don’t worry about working over time;
the entire force must be too much interested
in the success of the house to grumble
about work. And do not expect your employer
to allow you a greater expenditure
than the size of your town or the importance
of the house renders necessary. Make
your windows as attractive as possible at
the smallest outlay of money that may be
required, and in this way consider the interests
of your firm.</p>

which is rendered even more attractive by
a background showing the northern lights,
and constantly changing by means of an automatic

an ordinary drop curtain, before which at
a distance of three feet was placed a tarletan
curtain to lend the effect of distance.
The back scene is lighted by twelve border
lights that flash automatically every minute.
The front is also lighted by concealed
incandescents which flash when the back
lights are turned off. The stalactites used
are hexagon in shape. They are cotton batting,
and covered with ground frosting.
The lightning was effected by rollers and
an alternating current. The display was ten
feet deep, thirteen feet high and sixteen feet
wide.</p>

<p>INTERIOR EASTER DECORATION.—<i>Goldsman.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Interior display should be simple, harmonious,
artistic. Don’t attempt to bewilder
your customers. A woman in search of an
apron shies from a great bunch of aprons
swung from the ceiling, but is attracted by
a single apron tastefully displayed. So it
is with all goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day has gone by in the dry goods
business when a few dummies, draped with
dress goods and placed upon the ledge, will
suffice. Something more attractive is required.
Ladies especially like to see pretty
goods, and will invariably do their purchasing
where goods are brought out and displayed
in an attractive manner. Some firms
have objected to interior trimming, believing
that it requires too many goods to make
an effective trim, thus robbing the stocks.
This, however, is a gross mistake, as we
know from experience that pretty, effective
trims may be made with the use of comparatively
few goods. One idea which has
found favor among trimmers is that of dividing
off a ledge (where there is one of considerable
length) into booths, by the use of
draperies, and in each of these displaying
different lines of goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is perhaps one of the easiest effective
trims which may be put up, but where
time and space will permit we would suggest
that the trimmer get up some sort of
framework or something on which a few
goods may be displayed in such a manner
as to show them off to the best possible advantage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Admitting all the benefits of good advertising—and
surely there are no enterprising
merchants in these days who do not admit
them—it only remains to choose the
best methods. The simple display of a bolt
of goods is an advertisement, but a weak
one. How much more effective that same
piece of goods would become if spread out,
or draped, or made into some shape that
would mean something, create a mental
picture, and leave an impression on the
memory.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little ingenuity, a little taste, an idea
of the harmony of colors can do wonders
in the interior of any store, no matter what
the character of the stock may be, or its
quality or quantity. The thing to do is to
let your goods tell some clear, legible story
that shall be as plain to your customers as
was the handwriting on the wall of Belshazzar’s
palace to Daniel, the prophet.
Aside from printer’s ink and show window
displays, there is no better advertising, and
it costs very little.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem as though dress goods
might afford the very best opportunities for
making an attractive interior display. It is,
however, a fact that ordinarily this important
line is shown to the worst possible advantages.
One often sees an effort made at
display by piling up a lot of bright goods
on the end of a counter, and by filling a top
shelf with pretty folds of goods; but no attractive
effects are obtained. The risk of
soiling expensive fabrics is of course one
reason why a better show is not made, but
with a little care, a little ingenuity and more
or less trouble to make frequent changes of
goods, an exceedingly handsome display
can be made and run no risk whatever.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>LEDGES.</h3>

<p class='c010'>I show in this connection a large number
of ledge displays, which will serve as examples
of what may be done in this style of

and will convey many valuable ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The accompanying cut shows an arrangement
in which linens are used in connection
with china and lamps, making a very attractive
display.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this ledge display, the arches, six in
number, were puffed in white cheesecloth,
the edge being trimmed with coiled crepe
paper of a dark green shade. The six
arches represented three departments, the
first two silks, the next two linens, the others
dress goods. The wall, back of the
arches, was covered with lace curtains.
Palms were placed at intervals between the
arches, and the goods were as carefully displayed
as if they were in a show window.
The framework of the arches were built of
light strips. The entire display was imposing
and attractive.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>I wish to call the attention of my readers
to the desirability of trimming their
show-cases artistically, and the cut we show
of a show-case trim is an example of what
may be done in that line. The goods shown
are laces, trimmings, handkerchiefs, and
gloves, and the beauty of the display attracted
the eye of many customers of the
store and induced them to examine and purchase
the goods.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_229a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A neatly decorated show-case is shown in
the picture. The festooning of ribbons
against the back adds much to the beauty
of the display, which is as carefully arranged
as if in a window.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_229b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The accompanying illustration is an arch
erected in honor of the order of Odd Fellows,
and is a clever conception well carried
out. The three links were puffed over a
heavy cardboard and edged with twisted
draping cord. The arch also was panelled
with this cord. The letters “F. L. T.” were
suspended within the links by invisible
wires. As this arch was in connection with
an excellent display it attracted much attention
and assisted to sell many goods.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>AN ORIENTAL DISPLAY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>We reproduce on the next page four
views of an oriental display recently made
in the windows of John Wanamaker, of
New York City, by Leon F. Rubens.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>
<img src='images/i_230.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>MR. RUBENS’ ORIENTAL DISPLAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>The conditions unfortunately prohibited
taking a satisfactory photograph, as the
trim occupied the space of four panes, widely
divided by architectural iron work. The
problem of a successful display was thereby
complicated somewhat, as it was really necessary
to make four separate “pictures,”
having the effect of one when seen from
across the street. Mr. Wanamaker’s windows
are of ancient style, set high up and
being very narrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a window containing entirely oriental
goods the richness of coloring is one of the
main attractions, and in a photographic reproduction
this gorgeousness of color effect
is entirely lost; still one can imagine, in
looking at the pictures of this display, that
the color harmony must have been fully
equal to the masterly arrangement of the
goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>No very expensive goods were used, and
the trim is constructed without framework
or special fixtures.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_231a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>UNIQUE RUG DISPLAY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A very artistic arrangement of rugs is
shown. A series of large tubes were made
of carpet paper, and over them were pinned
rugs of various sizes. These tubes or pillars
were then stacked in an artistic group
and stuffed birds and ornaments placed upon
the tops.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>RIBBON STAR.</h3>

<p>DISPLAY OF TRIMMINGS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Framework of flat sticks, as used in window
shades; height of star, five feet; composed
entirely of numerous solid color ribbons,
edged with Roman stripe ribbon, to
give a neat finish. Ribbons were not cut
but folded back of star which was covered
at completion of trim with white cheesecloth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Background, pure white curtains.
This was an “overhead trim” at the ribbon
counter, and attracted quite a little attention.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A DISPLAY OF TRIMMINGS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>A circular arch is covered with elaborate
designs, and the figures in the center show
the proper application of the trimming.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A TROLLEY CAR.</h3>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_232a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Here is a reproduction of a trolley car,
trimmed entirely with handkerchiefs. The
details of the car, including brake, controller
and bell rope, are well carried out, and
the car stands upon its own rail and sleepers.
The car was first built of wood, and
covered with white cloth, after which the
handkerchiefs were pinned on.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>SKIRT DISPLAY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>In the accompanying sketch is presented
the production of a design which deserves
a place here for a double reason, because it
is not only an artistic effort, but eminently
practical and easy of imitation in a store of
moderate dimensions. The figure is nothing
more than the many you use from time
to time in your suit and cloak windows. For
the many who are not so lucky to have
whole forms you can use the bust forms by
placing them on a box until you get the required
height. If you have no hands use
the ones you have at the glove department
displaying gloves. In order to have the
hands and arms support the skirt you must
put a crutch under them. This is not seen,
and helps to keep the skirt in an even position.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_232b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A window so displayed would, I believe,
make a hit, as it is one of the best ways of
displaying skirts in an artistic way.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>“MISS MODESTY.”</h3>

<p class='c010'>While this display called attention to the
fact that corsets are part of women’s underwear,
and therefore might be called immodest
for that reason, still it suggests a good
idea for decorating with these goods.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<img src='images/i_233a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>

<p>“MISS MODESTY.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>FOUNTAIN DISPLAY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The “Fountain of Chiffon” is cleverly
conceived and executed, and is thus described
by the artist:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Size of window, width, nine feet; height,
seven feet six inches; depth, six feet; white,
spotted allover, net draped and festooned on
canary yellow lining for background.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On top is placed a three-feet-high flower
stand with eight pieces of millinery wire (in
two rows) in semi-circular form, on which
are thrown eight lengths of wide silk chiffon
(colors to match ruchings), no bluette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A hoop, five feet in diameter, made of
one-inch wood, is attached to a standard
and fastened to center of window floor.
White cotton covers the skeleton of the
whole goblet. Six yards of bluette tinseled
angel gauze make the vessel, including the
pillar, and six yards more of the
same material finishes the base. Twelve
lengths (five yards each) of chiffon ruching,
artistically selected colors (except bluette),
decorates the vessel, trims in spirals the pillar,
and falls in zigzags on base. Five yards
of six-inch guipure lace for the brim.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_233b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>FOUNTAIN DISPLAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Between each two pieces of chiffon are
arranged white ospreys. Five lengths of
white narrow silk chiffon are representing
streams overflowing brim of basin and falling
to ground.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>MILLINERY ARCH.</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Size of window.—Width, 9 feet; height,
7 feet 6 inches; depth, 6 feet. Size of arch.—Width,
7 feet; height, 7 feet 4 inches;
depth, 5 feet. Size of columns, including
base, shaft and capital, 4 feet 4 inches. Size
of base, 12 × 16 inches; shaft, 2 feet (6
inches in diameter); capital, 12 × 12 inches.
Size of arch from line of capital to center
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>of top, 3 feet 2 inches. Size of arch from
line of capital to center of inside line, 1 foot
8 inches.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_234a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“The whole is made of 1½ × ¾-inch
wood material.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Arch and columns, which are one foot
from glass plate, are previously whitewashed,
and then trimmed with Shogran
puffing of white cheese cloth.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'>BROOKLYN BRIDGE IN SPOOLS.</h3>

<p class='c010'>On another page is an excellent picture
of this successful trim. The reproduction
of the Brooklyn Bridge is so accurate that
Mr. Roebling would probably have been delighted
had he lived to see it. We furnish
diagrams of the towers, in which the dimensions
are accurately given. The foundations
were covered with grey cotton, to imitate
stone, and the balance of the superstructure
with boxes of white. Various vehicles were
shown upon the bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of one candle power electric
lights were placed upon the bridge, and a
large reflector, which the picture does not
show, was placed in the left upper corner to
represent the moon. These, and the torch
held by the Statue of Liberty, were the only
lights shown at night, and the effect was
very beautiful. There were 1,225 dozen
spools of cotton used in the construction
of the bridge, and after the display was taken
out a sale was made of these—7 spools
for 25c.—and they were sold out in a hurry.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_234b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The picture was enhanced by a good water
scene under the bridge, showing ships,
etc., the water being made to move by
means of a mechanical device. There was
a sea-wall at the rear, made of brick paper,
cotton being used to represent foam.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statue of “Liberty Enlightening the
World” was cleverly carried out. The upper
part was puffed with white cheesecloth.
A diagram explains the structure. By the
way, the photograph of this window sent us
was taken by electric light, a three minutes
exposure being given. The picture will be
seen to be perfectly free from reflections.</p>

<h3 class='c009'>A NOTION DISPLAY.</h3>

<p class='c010'>I offer the following suggestion for a
window, and although the central portion is
alone illustrated, and may be applied to any
sort of a trim, the general plan described
will be found to harmonize with the central
picture.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<img src='images/i_235.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>BROOKLYN BRIDGE IN SPOOL COTTON.—<i>Stetler.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Use green and yellow, in combination, for
the wall draperies, and drab for the floor.
Trim, in any manner that commends itself
to you, with handkerchiefs, embroideries
and notions, keeping each class of articles
in a separate group. Parasols at the front
corners, placed in fan-shaped holders, look
very well and dress a general display.</p>

<p class='c007'>The central design is a man with a wheelbarrow,
and another with a scoop shovel.
The barrow should be loaded with notions,
laces, handkerchiefs, gloves, etc. This feature
may be made mechanical by having the
barrow rest on an iron brace just back of
the wheel, and another brace fastened to the
floor and running up the pants leg of the
man holding the barrow. Cut a slot in the
floor so that the wheel of the barrow just
touches an endless band beneath. Have the
man’s knees and hips jointed and connected
with a rod running through another slot in
the floor and connected with a wheel underneath,
so that the same motion is obtained
as when a man rides a bicycle. One motor
will operate both the man’s legs and the
wheel of the barrow. The floor should be
strewn with the same class of goods contained
in the barrow and a small heap
should be just in front of the scoop shovel.
It would be well to have a small price card
fastened to each article.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_236a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>PICKING UP.</h3>

<p class='c010'>As a central figure for a notion display
you may make a large star, divided into five
diamonds, or points, as shown in the picture.
These are each filled in with small
notions, and the remainder of the background
trimmed as you please. The central
figure is the main point, and gives character
to any trim, so that if you get the central
idea the rest is easy. Two jointed, or,
better yet, flexible forms are needed for this
window. One is stooping down and picking
up small notions and placing them in
a basket. The other form bears a mouth
card, reading, “How is business?” The
stooping form replies, by a similar mouth
card, “Picking up,” etc.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br> <span class='c008'>PRACTICAL TRIMS IN ALL LINES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I have selected as examples of good trims
in every line of dry goods some of the best
designs that have appeared during the past
three years in the popular window-trimming
journal, <i>The Show Window</i>. In no
other place could I hope to find such representative
work of the best decorators in
America, and as my selection has been made
with great care, I feel it is a panorama of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the most artistic and practical window displays
ever yet congregated for the study
and consideration of the thoughtful decorator.
<i>The Show Window</i> is published under
the auspices of The National Association
of Window Trimmers of America, an
organization that includes the most famous
window trimmers in the United States and
Canada and has done more to advance decorative
art in America than any other institution.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_237a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Study with care these illustrations. When
you wish to put in a window in any line
turn to this book and select a design that
pleases you. Erect your framework to fit
your window, making what alterations in
the plan your judgment or circumstances
dictate. Then cover with suitable material,
taking care to use harmonious combinations
of colors. Last of all, decorate with
such goods as you have at your command.
You cannot fail. You are sure to create an
attractive display, the qualities being of
course more or less dependent upon the
skill you acquire. You cannot be an expert
decorator the first time you try; but you
can make a successful display, and I really
believe that if my instructions are thoughtfully
read and pondered any man of ability
will be able to perfect himself in the necessary
details of the art. After that the matter
lies within yourself. If you have confidence
in yourself, energy and perseverance,
united to a fair share of heaven-born talent,
you can win your way to prosperity and
fame as a professional decorator.</p>
